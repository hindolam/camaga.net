        often travel within U.S. and Canada to accompany visiting Carnatic musicians 
        on the mirudangam or to speak at universities about Indian music. A question 
        that is frequently asked during these visits, not only by Westerners but 
        also by people of Indian-origin is, "Is Indian music, religious music?" 
        My answer is: Yes and No. </font></b></font></o:p>
<p><o:p></o:p><font color="#333366"><b><font size="3"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          word 'religion' can be interpreted in many ways. If we interpret 'religion' 
          to mean the faith, practices and biases of a specific community, then 
          no, Indian music is not religious music. If we interpret 'religion' 
          to mean a path that guides us to universal values - values that help 
          us rise above prejudices and limitations and realize the true purpose 
          of our lives - then yes, Indian music is religious music. Yeats, the 
          famous Irish poet, says that while it is complex in theory and practice, 
          Indian music is not just an art but description of life itself. </font></o:p></font></b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#333366"><b><font size="3"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Indian 
          classical music is one of the oldest, if not the oldest music system, 
          in the world. As early as 400 B. C., classical music systems began to 
          develop in India. The Vedas, written thousands of years ago provide 
          the earliest reference to Indian music. One of the ritual elements of 
          the Vedas is the chant. The chants are musical expositions and are used 
          for individual and group recitation of mantras. Epic stories such as 
          the Ramayana and the Mahabharatha, the Buddhist scriptures and the Brahminical 
          literature also provide references to music and musicians. Similar references 
          to the development of music can be found in the medieval and modern 
          literatures. Further analysis of this literature shows that while the 
          compositions frequently used religious and mythological anecdotes, music, 
          as an art, had developed independently of the Hindu religions. Music 
          was not treated as an integral part of the religious rituals but as 
          a separate cultured and aesthetic activity. In other words, in India, 
          music was always considered a secular art. </font></o:p></font></b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#333366"><b><font size="3"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">If 
          Indian music is indeed a secular art, then why does it contain so many 
          mythological and religious references? Music, like any other art form, 
          is created by people and is an expression of their lives and culture. 
          For thousands of years, the heroes and villains of mythology were household 
          names in India. The legends and tales of these heroes and villains filled 
          Indian households and even today, they are featured prominently in films, 
          magazines and comic books. The stories have created larger-than-life 
          images of these characters and produced reverence and awe in the minds 
          of children and adults alike. Therefore, it is no surprise that, to 
          the Indian poets and composers, the mythological stories and the players 
          from these stories were a never-ending source to decorate and embellish 
          the music. Although the composers viewed music as a divine activity, 
          they did not use these stories as an excuse to promote their personal 
          agenda or publicize religious faith or orchestrated rituals. In their 
          view, music is a powerful tool and it must be used to affect social 
          change -- to convey important social messages and the central truths 
          of human existence. </font></o:p></font></b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#333366"><b><font size="3"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          twin belief that music is a divine activity and music can be used to 
          trigger social change - encouraged these poets and composers to draw 
          examples from Hindu mythology. The composers believed that using mythology 
          and religion as a background would be an effective way to convey the 
          sublime messages of wisdom put forth by visionaries throughout the ages. 
          People can identify with the mythological and religious stories that 
          they grew up hearing. Thus, with the addition of music to the description 
          of gods and goddesses and their lives, the listener can be transported 
          from the ordinary world to a higher spiritual and moral world. We can 
          find support for these notions in thousands of compositions written 
          by hundreds of composers. However, I will cite from the work of one 
          of the best-known music composers of Indian music, Saint Thyagaraja. 
          </font></o:p></font></b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#333366"><b><font size="3"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Saint 
          Thyagaraja lived in Tiruvayar, a small hamlet on the banks of the river 
          Cauvery in Tamilnadu. Thyagaraja was born in a society that was divided 
          by caste. The people from his community followed the religious rituals 
          meticulously but ignored the inner wisdom and meaning of these rituals. 
          Thyagaraja, a revolutionary, decided that he should use his compositions 
          to highlight the society's ills and point to values and conduct necessary 
          to overcome these ills. Drawing frequently from the Ramayana and its 
          hero, Rama (an incarnation of Vishnu), Thyagaraja illustrated the importance 
          of ethical and moral conduct in several of his compositions. He described 
          Rama's life and how Rama accepted misery with fortitude and never swerved 
          from the righteous path. Although Thyagaraja worshipped Rama and used 
          Rama as the principal character in most of his compositions, he never 
          promoted Rama as the only god or his religious beliefs as the only path 
          to salvation. On the contrary, he advises us against using our religion 
          or beliefs to discriminate against people of different faiths. In the 
          words of Thyagaraja, God does not care whether you are an Advaitist 
          or a Dwaitist (followers of the two major Hindu philosophies). For the 
          truly liberated, labels and names make no difference. A truly religious 
          person is one who transcends divisions and denominations (in other words, 
          it does not matter whether you are a Hindu, a Christian, or a Muslim). 
          </font></o:p></font></b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#333366"><b><font size="3"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Thyagaraja's 
          compositions also contain messages about every day life and its activities. 
          He claims that the purpose of education should not be to earn money 
          or to publicize one's accomplishments. Education should be used to mold 
          ones character and knowledge must be used to benefit ones society. A 
          donkey or a mule that carries a load of books on its back does not become 
          a scholar. Likewise, Thyagaraja also criticizes blind adherence to religious 
          rites without understanding the true meaning behind these rituals. He 
          says rituals for rituals' sake is useless; one must strive to use the 
          ritualistic practices to develop mental discipline. "What is the purpose 
          in doing pooja by ringing a bell, burning camphor, and sitting cross 
          legged, if all the while your mind is racing and thinking of money, 
          wealth, and power?" The birds and the fish bathe in water several times 
          a day. Does that make them spiritually liberated? The Stork and the 
          Crane stand on the banks of the river on one leg. Does that mean they 
          are doing penance and praying? They too are following their own rituals 
          but cannot claim spiritual enlightenment from this alone. The religious 
          rituals are vital to our lives. But, like the stork and the crane, the 
          rituals should not be used to obtain immediate gratification but should 
          be used to cleanse ourselves physically and mentally. </font></o:p></font></b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#333366"><b><font size="3"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">On 
          personal responsibilities, Thyagaraja says that we are responsible for 
          our actions. "No one else is responsible but I for my happiness and 
          sorrow." There is no point in asking an external God to save us from 
          internal misery. Inside each of us there resides a God and a Devil. 
          Poets and philosophers from other cultures also emphasize this view. 
          Schopenhauer, the German philosopher, says, "If you are looking for 
          God outside of yourself you are wasting your time." Jalaludhin Rumi, 
          the Iranian poet, says, "If you want to see the devil, look into the 
          mirror." But the interplay between the devil and God within ourselves 
          is the age-old drama that makes us either strive for personal greatness 
          or succumb to the pursuit of worldly possessions. This interplay is 
          also reinforced by Thyagaraja's message. The religious anecdotes and 
          references are only a means to an end. The ultimate objective is examining 
          our society, our lives, and our environment and improving our surroundings. 
          Religious stories merely dramatize these messages and help the listener 
          in relating to the true meaning of what is being said. Thus I conclude 
          that using examples from religion and mythology do not make the songs 
          religious music. The illustrative tools are simply one more component 
          within the system of music that complement the other components such 
          as notes, rhythm, and the grammar - all of which are essential to support 
          the edifice of music. </font></o:p></font></b><font size="3"><o:p></o:p></font></font><font color="#003366"><font size="3"><o:p></o:p></font></font></p>
