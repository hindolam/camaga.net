<p align="center"><font color="#800040" size="6">The Trinity</font></p>
<p>The most notable period for Carnatic music was the 18/19th centuries when three 
  of the greatest composers of the music system lived and composed songs. These 
  three great composers - Syama Sastri (1767-1847), Thyagaraja (1767-1847) and 
  Muthuswamy Dishitar (1775-1835) - are called the Triniti's of Carnatic music. 
  What distinguished the Trinity from other composers of Carnatic music is not 
  only the number of compositions they composed but the messages that their songs 
  contained. Indian music and Carnatic music in particular, was both an emotional 
  and an intellectual phenomenon. While the songs and the music projected an image 
  of religion and devotion, it was much more than these attributes; it was also 
  a spiritual exercise that took the ordinary mortal from the everyday living 
  to a higher state of philosophy and liberation. Saint Thyagaraja, in particular, 
  showed us that nadopasana or the practice of music is the path towards moksha 
  or liberation. Therefore, collectively, the contributions of the Carnatic music 
  Trinities to Indian philosophy and spirituality is unparalled. I strongly urge 
  the younger readers of this article, especially those growing up in the Western 
  World, to understand the meaning of the Carnatic music compositions and use 
  them for your everyday life.</p>
<p>All three of the Trinities lived and composed in Thanjavur, in Tamilnadu. Thanjavur 
  is virtually the Carnatic Music Capital, not only because the Trinities lived 
  there but also because the place has nurtured Carnatic music since time immemorial. 
  The Kings from Thanjavur - the Cholas, Nayaks, and the Marathas - have consistently 
  supported Carnatic music and the artists, and contributed to its current day 
  greatness and preservation. Apart from the Trinities, several great Carnatic 
  Music composers were either born or lived and composed in and around Thanjavur. 
  Some of these stalwarts include: Varahappa Dikshit Pandit, Pachimiriyam Adiyappayyah, 
  Govinda Dikshita, Venkatamakhi, Subbaraya Sastry, and Patnam Subramania Iyer 
  and the well-known Thanjavur quartet: Chinnaiah, Ponnaiah, Vadivelu and Sadashivam. 
</p>
<p><strong>Syama Sastry: (1763-1847 AD): </strong>Syama Sastri was born in 1762 
  to Visvanatha Iyer and Vengalakshmi. The name given to him at birth was Venkata 
  Subrahmanya. He was proficient in both Sanksrit and Telugu. Even at a young 
  age, he was highly proficient in music. Although he had initial music training 
  from his cousins, later he came under the tutelage of a great sanyasi from Benares, 
  Sangitha Swami and then from Pachimiriyam Adiyappayya (see his biography in 
  Pre-Trini composers).</p>
<p>Syama Sastry composed most of his songs in Telugu and mostly in praise of Goddess 
  Parvathi or Ambal. However, as Smt. Vidhya Shankar has shown, some of the compositions 
  were in Tamil (Gowli Panthu: tarunam idamma) as well as in Sanskrit and also 
  one of the compositions in praise of Lord Karthikeya, son of Goddess Parvathi. 
  Syama Sastry and Muthuswamy Dishitar and Sri Thyagaraja, all lived in Thanjavur 
  District of Tamilnadu. Syama Sastri always sought the blessing of the Goddess 
  when he was in difficult circumstances. According to one story, Kesavayya, a 
  great musician, was visiting Thanjavur and the King asked Syama Sastri to have 
  a competition with him on music. Before doing so, Syama Sastri went to the temple 
  and prayed to Goddess Parvathi, and sang the composition, &quot;Devi brova samayamide' 
  or &quot;Oh Goddess Parvathi, this is the time for you to help me and to protect 
  me.&quot; He later went to the auditorium and won the competition against Kesavayya. 
  Similarly, during his visit to Madurai, Syama Sastri composed the now famous 
  &quot;Navaratna Malika&quot; or nine kritis in parise of Goddess Meenakshi. 
</p>
<p>Syama Sastri's greatest contribution was the swarajathi. He converted these 
  from their dance form to the musical form that we now know of. Some of Syama 
  Sastri's swarajatis include: Kamakshi Anudinamu (Bharivai), Kamakshi Ni Padayugame 
  (Yadukula Kambhoji), and Rave Himagiri Kumari (Todi). Syama Sastri has composed 
  songs not only in popular ragas such as Todi, Kalyani, and Sankarabharanam but 
  also in rare ragas such as Manji, Chintamani (Devi Brova Samayamidhi that I 
  had referred earlier), and Kalagada. Another noteworthy contribution of Syama 
  Sasti to Carnatic music is related to the layam or thalam aspects. He illustrated 
  and and highlighted Viloma style of Chapu thalam (4 plus 3 instead of the more 
  common 3 + 4). Another thala contribution of Syama Sastri worthy of mention 
  is the kriti &quot;Sankari Samkaru (Saveri)&quot;. This kriti can be sung either 
  in Rupaka Talam or Adi Talam (Tisra Gati). Some of Syama Sastri's discicples 
  are: Subbaraya Sasti (Syama Sastri's son), Alasur Krishnayyar, and Tharangambadi 
  Panchanathayyar.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Muthuswamy Dikshitar (1776-1835): </strong>Dikshitar is the youngest 
  of the trinities. He was born in 1776 to Sri Ramaswamy Dikshitar and Mrs. Subbulakshmi 
  Ammal. Somewhat similar to Syama Sastri, Dikshitar also learns music from s 
  Sanyasi from Benares, Chidambaranatha Yogi. One of the distinguishing feature 
  of Dikshitar is that he was not only proficient in Carnatic music but also in 
  Hindustani music (the Dhrupad style). Dikshitar's first composition was rendered 
  in Tiruttani, about sixty miles from Madras city. In the Tiruttani Lord Muruga's 
  temple, Dikshitar composed his first song, Srinathadi Guruguho Jayati Jayati 
  (Mayamalavagowla).</p>
<p>Like Thyagaraja, Dikshitar has composed several &quot;sthala&quot; kritis or 
  compositions in praise of the God or Goddess of a holy town. For example, Dikshitar 
  has composed kritis in parise of Ekambaranathar in Kancheepuram, Shiva of Vaitheeswaran 
  Koil, Meenakshi of Madurai, and in other places. Similarly, he has also composed 
  group of kritis in praise of Lord Shiva and the five elements that he represented. 
  These include: Prithvi Chintaya (Bhairavi) in Kancheepuram representing the 
  element Earth, Jambupathe Mampahi (Yamunakalyani) in Thirunavaikkaval representing 
  the element, Water; Arunachala (Saranga) in Thiruvannamalai representing the 
  element Fire, Sri Kalahastisa (Huseini) in Kalahasti (near Thirupathi) representing 
  the element Air; and Ananda Natana (Kedaram) in Chidambaram representing the 
  Ether or atmosphere. Dikshitar also composed kritis representing each day of 
  the week called VAra kritis. Actually, these consist of nine kritis, seven to 
  represent the seven days of the week and the last to represent two other grahams 
  or planets. For example, the Navavarna kritis, as they are called include kritis 
  such as: Budham asrayami (Natakurunji), Brihaspate (Atana), Angarakam, Surya 
  Murthe. </p>
<p>Most of Dikshitar's kritis were in written in the Sanksrit language but some 
  were in Telugu and a few even in Manipravalam or more than one language. He 
  ended his kritis with his stamp or Mudra, Guruguha. One of the most well known 
  kriti of Dikshitar is: Vatapi Ganapatim (Hamsadhwani), Annapoorne (Sama), Kanjadalayatakshi 
  (Kamalamanohari) and so on.<br>
</p>
<p> <strong>Saint Thyagaraja (1767-1947):</strong> Sri Thyagaraja Swami, as he 
  was popularly known, was the greatest composer of all times and the most well-known 
  of the Trinities. He was born to Ramabrahmam and Seetamma and learnt music from 
  Sonti Venkataramana. Like the other two of his contemporaries, Syama Sastry 
  and Dikshitar, Sri Thyagaraja Swami also lived in Thanjavur. </p>
<p>Thyagaraja Swami is credit with composing over 2,000 compositions. His great 
  contributions also extend to to developing and streamlining the kriti form (transition 
  from kirtana - see the article on Musical forms) and in the thalas, for introducing 
  the anagata eduppu or compositions starting after the first beat.such as, &frac14; 
  , &frac12; , &frac34; and 1&frac12; beats after the sama. His compositions are 
  mainly in the Telugu language and he has used multitude of ragas, both popular 
  (Todi, Kalyani aarabhi) and rare ragas such as Kalavathi, Manoranajani. He also 
  composed two dance dramas (Nowka Charitham and Prahlada Baktha Vijayam) and 
  several group kritis used for special occassions such as the Divyanama Kritis 
  and Utsava Sampradaya Kritis. His Pancharathanas are the most well-known (five 
  gems in the ragas Nattai, Gowlai, aarabhi, Varali and Sri). </p>
<p>Many musical scholars and philosophers consider Thyagaraja Swami to be more 
  than a composer. He is considered an &quot;avatara pursha&quot; or a &quot;Great 
  Soul&quot; who led through life and interpreted religion, morals, and values 
  in contemporary terms, in the light of the times in which they were born. Thyagaraja 
  Swami was the first composer whose compositions dealt with human beings - their 
  problems, society's ills and the consequent belief in wrong values. His teachings 
  were ecumenical and catholic and opposed the narrow belifes and biases of human 
  beings because of caste, religion, and origin. Thyagaraja Swami not only wrote 
  about moral values and freedom from bias but, he also lived a simple and pure 
  life to demonstrate to the world that the purpose of education and erudition 
  was to mould character. </p>
<p>No other composer has been praised so highly by so many generations of composers 
  and savants. From his own time to this day, composers have sung in his praise 
  and wherever Carnatic music flourishes, there are aradhanas conducted as a homage 
  to him. Many have wondered why all this praise has been showered on this composer 
  and why an aradhana is organized only for him. The simple and basic answer is 
  that he sang about man and the path to lasting happiness; he sang about music 
  and nadha and, above all else, he led a life of Spartan simplicity and truth; 
  totally rejecting the temptation to live a physically comforable life and rejecting 
  offers of wealth and possession even from King Sarabhoji. There is no other 
  composer with such a large and impressive array of shishyas or disciples; there 
  is no other composer whose life story was written down by his own shishyas, 
  even during his own life time and finally, there is no other composer who taught 
  us &quot;Sulabhumuga kadatheranu soochana&quot; (ManasaA Etulone - Malayamarudham) 
  or the easy means to salvation or liberation (worship through music or Nadopasana). 
  His works appeal to the scholar and the ignorant alike. To those taking an intellectual 
  approach to life's problems as well as to those who need an emotional solution, 
  he has the right answer.</p>
<p>I do not wish to add any further lines to describe the greatness of Sri Thyagaraja, 
  who has aptly been called Saint Thyagaraja. A few paragraphs are not adequate 
  to do so. I have dedicated an entire webpage with numerous articles (Musicology 
  of Thyagaraja) written by musicology scholars such as Sri T.S. Parthasarathy 
  and Dr. R. Krishnaswamy (Founder and former President of Sadguru Sangeetha Samajam). 
  I strongly urge the readers to read these articles because they contain valuable 
  gems that no money can buy or no penance or yagna can deliver.</p>
