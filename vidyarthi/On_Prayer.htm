        <p><strong>Aldoux Huxley classified prayer into petition, intecession, mediatation, 
          and contemplation. Of these, petition, he said, was the lowest form 
          of prayer; intercession the next best; mediation still higher and contemplation, 
          the ideal. This closely follows Sri Thyagaraja Swami's views on prayer. 
          In the kriti, &quot;Mari Mari Ninne&quot; in Kamboji, he refers to the 
          bhakthis of Gajendra, Druva, and Prahalada. Gajendra merely wanted to 
          be physically saved (tamasika bhakthi). Druva wanted a boon which was 
          almost asking for revenge or taunt his step mother and weak father - 
          Rajasika bhakthi. Prahlada who merely wanted his father to know the 
          omni presence of God Stavika bhakthi. In the Devamanohari kriti, &quot;Kanni 
          thandri Naapai, &quot; Swami says people will just continue to do what 
          they have been doing day in day out without realizing that man is his 
          own friend or foe; the friendship and strength being derived from control 
          of the senses, thereby stressing the point that the human mind is a 
          very powerful instrument which if tame and properly utilized, can lift 
          man up from sorrow. He tells us that all rituals are directed towards 
          this sure method of obtaining control of the mind but that such control 
          can only come from concentrating on the purpose of the ritual.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Perfunctory performance of ritual will give no benefit. Two 
          kritis explain this. In &quot;Telisi Rama Chinthanatho&quot; (Poorna 
          Ravichandrika), he draws attention to the dual meanings of words and 
          says that what the mind is meditating on is more important than words 
          itself. Rama means woman and also Brahman; Arka means the sun god and 
          a poisonous plant and Aja means Brahma or goat. So, just chanting Rama 
          nama without at the same time benefiting your mind with the right image 
          in your thoughts is of no use.</strong></p>
        <p><strong> Another important ingredient of prayer is love of God and 
          fellow human beings. In &quot;Rama Neeyeda&quot; (Karaharapriya) and 
          &quot;Smarane Sukhamu&quot; in Janaranjani, he stresses this point. 
          In the pancharathna kriti, &quot;Sadinchene&quot; in Arabhi, he refers 
          to this and says &quot;boidnchina sanmarga vachana mulu bonku chesi&quot; 
          meaning that God falsified his own teaching which means that he falsified 
          what you believed was an invulnerable situation for yourself.</strong></p></td>
