<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When CNN started a news channel that would provide 24-hours
of non-stop news, it was considered a fabulous idea.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For those wanting to be up-to-date on their
World events, news junkies like me, this was a gift from the heavens.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Or so we thought. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Since CNN came into existence, many networks across the
world have also begun to follow the 24-hour news model.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>CNN itself, over the years, has given birth
to multiple variations of its news network such as the Airport News Network (ANN)
with TV monitors in every airport and in every boarding and waiting area; TNN
or Train News Network, which provides news to commuters traveling to work on
metropolitan trains; and Cruise News Network, which broadcasts news even to
those sitting in a ship in the middle of<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>the ocean. Perhaps, they will soon introduce a Sleeping News Network and
a Bathroom News Network so that people can have access to news at all times.
Could we ask for better service?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But seriously; are there so many important events taking
place in the world that we, as humans, need 24-hour news?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As an ordinary citizen (unless one is the
Prime Minister of India or the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>), is it necessary for one to be so
“well informed?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Recently, I was on a commuter train traveling towards the
airport to catch a flight. The commuter train has a TV monitor in every
compartment broadcasting news continually.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>As a captive audience, I had no choice but to watch.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“Bus falls over bridge.” “Gunman kills fellow
college students – 32 students killed.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>“Man attacks his wife and kidnaps new born baby.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“Disgruntled employee opens fire on
colleagues.” And on and on went the news, with more killings, violence, and
misery. By the time the train reached the airport, I needed an anti-depressant.
Not having one, I was tempted to jump out of the moving train to avoid
listening to any more news.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After reaching the boarding gates, my wait for the flight
began. The inimitable TV monitors were all around me again, this time
broadcasting international news from CNN. Unlike in the commuter train, news
about local rapists and child molesters was replaced by news of international
murder and tragedy. “Five <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region>
soldiers killed in an ambush.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“Bomb
goes off in Iraqi market.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“Killing
continues in <st1:place>Darfur</st1:place>.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>“Israeli jets pound Palestinian settlements.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“Ethiopian airliner crashes. 150 Passengers
killed. ” By this time, I was sufficiently frustrated.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What is wrong with these news networks and
their listeners?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I sat there muttering
to myself, “Why is everyone obsessed with death, destruction, and mayhem?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How can anyone find other people’s misery so
interesting?”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Watching television should make us feel positive; it should
make us proud of ourselves for belonging to the human race.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And while news is a reflection of our society
and times, it appears as though we are forsaking coverage of good news to make
space for “shock-value” news. We seem to be fascinated by news about degrading
and destructive behavior and only discuss the lowest common denominators among
us. Perhaps, this is the reason why more people watch mega serials and soap
operas than real-life news.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As my thoughts wandered from war and genocide to mega
serials, I wondered what happened to <st1:PersonName>Priya</st1:PersonName> in
the “Sogam” serial. In the last episode, she was planning to have her mother in
law killed by an ex-convict.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Did she
succeed?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Well, <st1:PersonName>Priya</st1:PersonName>
did not know that her mother in law was also plotting to poison her. I wonder
who got the ax first. Ramu, <st1:PersonName>Priya</st1:PersonName>’s husband
would be happy if both his mother and wife died because he can then marry his
girlfriend, Mala.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Unlike the feisty and plotting <st1:PersonName>Priya</st1:PersonName>,
Ramya in the “Pookkal” serial is very different. She is very innocent and
naïve. Ramya only wanted her husband to marry another woman so that his family’s
progeny will continue. Unfortunately, as soon as the second marriage took
place, her mother in law had thrown her out of the house.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Her husband has also gone missing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After all, is it wrong to marry your husband
off to multiple women to keep the family tree growing?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is keeping a harem such a new concept; it has
existed throughout the history of mankind. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The “Shanthi” serial is even more thrilling than the
others.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I don’t think Shanthi knows that
it is her father-in-law who killed her father and usurped all the property from
him. Once Shanthi signs the property in his name, the father in law is
definitely going to get rid of her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I woke up from my reverie about mega serials to the
announcement that boarding had started for my flight.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As I stood up, I could not but wonder why
humans get such vicarious pleasure from listening and watching news and events
that portray cunning, plotting, death and destruction. At least, our
fascination with news about misery and destruction can be explained as a “need”
- we must know how unjust and terrible the world is sometimes so that we can
protect ourselves from such events and where possible, change the world to be a
better place to live. But, I cannot comprehend our fascination with watching
cunning and betrayal and the subliminal pleasure we get from entertainment that
portrays our basest emotions. While, to a certain degree, art is an imitation
of real life, it appears as if our mega serials reflect the worst in us and how
terrible we can be to each other.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Perhaps,
we are secretly glad that it is happening to some one else and we are not the
people who are causing it or affected by it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As author Ian Fleming describes, James Bond is the fictional
character, who at a middle age, can jump from a helicopter, attract young
beautiful blonds and swim in a tank full of sharks. James Bond let other middle
age men live in the fantasy world of sex and guns that they can only
imagine.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe, like the James Bond
episodes, the mega serials let us fantasize and “clinically” be a part of
events that we are neither capable of designing nor have the stomach to
participate in.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As long as we can
maintain our sanity, fantasy is not bad after all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Perhaps Shakespeare should have said, “Oh! Fantasy, Thou Art
Human.” </p>
