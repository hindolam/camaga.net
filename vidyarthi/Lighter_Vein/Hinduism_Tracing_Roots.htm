        <p class=MsoNormal> <font size="3"><b><o:p><font face="Times New Roman">It 
          is not an exaggeration to state that in India everything we know about 
          art, culture, and even politics has its roots in Hinduism. In this issue, 
          let us look at a short history of Hinduism. How has Hinduism as a religion 
          evolved and changed with the lives of those who practice it? Why is 
          Hinduism as relevant today as it was 3,000 years ago? The answer to 
          these questions lies in the philosophy behind the religion rather than 
          the rituals and practices of the religion. </font></o:p></b></font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Indian civilization began 
          hundreds of years ago, long before the birth of Christianity and long 
          before Europe and the rest of the Western world became organized and 
          civilized. Over 2,500 years before Christ was born, in India, there 
          were prosperous and thriving communities living in the cities of Harappa 
          and Mohenjo-daro in Northern India called the Aryans (a honorific word 
          meaning &quot;superior being&quot;). Although a few claim that the Aryans 
          were of Indo-European origin, recent archeological evidences contradict 
          this claim. The Aryan communities were known as the Indus valley civilization 
          and they were dependent on agriculture. Accordingly, the people worshipped 
          the land, the water and the atmosphere - elements that were adopted 
          as symbols of what would later be called Hinduism. It was during this 
          period that Vedic literature -- the Upanisads, the Samhitas and the 
          Brahmanas were developed.</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Each Veda consisted of four 
          parts: the Mantras or the hymns; the Brahmanas or explanations on mantras; 
          the Aranyakas or meditations; and, the Upanisads, treatises on spiritual 
          matters. In general, the Vedas were ritualistic texts and provided step-by-step 
          instructions on dealing with everything - from birth of a child to marriage 
          between man and woman to death of an individual. For example, the Vedas 
          provided guidance on what prayers and mantras one should recite in the 
          morning and at bed time; how sacrifices must be offered to a God; how 
          a marriage should be conducted and so on. There were four Vedas (Rig, 
          Atharvana, Sama, and Yejur) and over twelve Upanisads. </b></font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>The Upanisads were composed 
          around 500 B.C. and were philosophical texts that contained discussions 
          between a teacher and a student. The teachings often criticized the 
          ritualistic and procedural approach to life described in the other Vedas 
          and urged people to seek a higher purpose in life. The Upanisads focused 
          on elevating the ordinary individual to a higher philosophical level 
          rather than simply giving the individual rules to live by. </b></font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>The Aryans were nomadic people 
          who moved from place to place. Around 400 B.C., they finally settled 
          around the river Ganges and thus emerged the beginnings of the country 
          of India. The Hindu epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharatha, were written 
          around this period. The two epics narrated the lives of kings and other 
          royalties and reflected the beliefs and revolved around the conflicting 
          values projected in the early Vedas and the Upanishads. For example, 
          while the Vedas asked an individual to perform rituals and help maintain 
          an orderly society, the Upanisads required an individual to renounce 
          everything, leave the society and become an ascetic. The Mahabharata 
          and Ramayana grew out of these often incompatible world views and the 
          actors from these two epics portrayed these conflicts. </b></font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>In the Mahabharatha, two royal 
          clans - the Pandavas and the Kauravas - are fighting a war with each 
          other for control over a kingdom. Yudishtra, the eldest of the five 
          Pandava brothers is very depressed by the war and the killing and wants 
          to renounce the hard won kingdom, the wealth and the power and retire 
          to a forest for the rest of his life. However, he is discouraged from 
          doing so because he is royalty and he has an obligation to his citizens. 
          It is his duty to preserve order and take care of the welfare of his 
          people. Eventually, Yudishtra is compelled to put aside his inner conflicts, 
          obey his assigned duties and take over the reins of the kingdom. In 
          the Ramayana, Rama, the hero of the story, is torn between the law of 
          the land which requires the eldest son to inherit the kingdom from his 
          father and his father Dasaratha's request that Rama give up the right 
          to the kingdom in favor of his younger brother, Bharatha, and retire 
          to a forest for fourteen years. Rama is torn between the dilemma of 
          following the law and disobeying his father. Should he refuse to handover 
          the kingdom to his younger brother or should he follow his father's 
          request and retire to a forest? Rama decides that moral obligation to 
          his father is more important than the law of the land; Rama renounces 
          his title to the kingdom and retires to a forest. Conflicts such as 
          these, where an individual is pulled among personal desires, social 
          obligations and responsibility to others are still relevant today. The 
          greatness of the stories from the Mahabharatha and the Ramayana are 
          that they provide us guidance on dealing with conflicts and illustrate 
          the benefits and repercussions of our choices. </b></font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>In keeping with the theme 
          of moral conflicts, around 600 A.D., the ingenious Hindus developed 
          the concept of bhakthi. The word bhakthi refers to action, service, 
          attachment, loyalty, worship, knowledge, and devotion to a personal 
          God. Through devotion to a God, an individual learns to deal with the 
          problems of every day life. In India, worship of a God is much more 
          than a passive belief in a superior force or an authority. Bhakthi is 
          a highly personal activity, where an individual worships a God according 
          to his or her preferences. Bhakthi helps an individual to become mature 
          and learn to cope with the trials and tribulations of life. An individual 
          need not be a scholar or a philosopher to be a devotee of God. Everyone, 
          regardless of age, education, or standing in life can practice bhakthi 
          and because it is personal, an individual can worship God in any form 
          or fashion he or she prefers. This is one of the prime reasons why Hindus 
          worship so many Gods and in so many forms and names. Bhakthi allows 
          us to humanize God and to express love, devotion, compassion and other 
          emotions as humans. However, the basic principle of Hinduism remains, 
          &quot;true God is within oneself and one must look inward to find God.&quot; 
          Bhakthi is a path that leads to this profound knowledge. </b></font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>I will conclude with a short 
          note on the modern history of Hinduism. Two important historical events 
          influenced Hinduism in later years, the Muslim invasion of India around 
          the 8th century and British occupation of India from around the 18th 
          century. The interaction with foreign cultures began to change Indians 
          and their views on Hinduism. A few individuals, reformers as they were 
          known, began to question some of the beliefs and values of traditional 
          Hinduism. These reformers included: Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Ramakrishna, 
          Vivekananda, and Mahatma Gandhi. A few of these reformers even suggested 
          that Hindus adopt Western ideas of service and humanism and move away 
          from individual liberation as the principle goal of Hinduism. A true 
          depiction of these reformist ideas is well reflected through the life 
          of Mahatama Gandhi. Gandhi believed that true devotion comes from service 
          to others and from helping people less privileged than oneself. Gandhi 
          became the voice of the poor, the oppressed and the untouchable people 
          of India. Liberation, in the words of Gandhi, meant liberation from 
          hatred, caste prejudices, economic and political slavery imposed by 
          foreigners. Religion, in Gandhi's view, meant equality of all beings, 
          regardless of caste, creed, power or wealth. God, in Gandhi's opinion, 
          lived within the soul of every being and God was indifferent to your 
          possessions.</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>This short history of Hinduism 
          illustrates that as a religion, Hinduism cannot be traced to the authoritative 
          statements of a founder or a leader. It is the product of the collective 
          reflections of many people -- from ritualistic scholars to reform-minded 
          liberals. In spite of the diversity of gods and goddesses and various 
          rituals and practices, Hindus, one and all, believe that that there 
          is only one God. And regardless of how differently we interpret that 
          God, Hinduism as a whole remains unaffected. Perhaps this willingness 
          to have faith in the intangibles and yet mold our beliefs is what has 
          enabled Hinduism to remain relevant today - it has evolved along with 
          centuries of human evolution. </b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><br>
