        <font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#003366"><b>Recently, I was 
        in Cleveland, Ohio to participate in the Aradhana celebrations (Carnatic 
        Music festival). The Cleveland Aradhana is celebrated annually and is 
        the most prominent Indian classical music festival in North America. Every 
        year, the Aradhana committee invites celebrated Carnatic musicians from 
        India to perform during the festival. It also invites artists living in 
        U.S. and Canada. </b></font> 
        <p><b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman" color="#003366">Most of the 
          invitees stay at the Comfort Inn in Euclid Avenue because it is located 
          within walking distance from the Cleveland State University auditoriums 
          where the performances are held. April is the beginning of the spring 
          season in North America and the weather is generally comfortable in 
          most cities. However, Cleveland, situated on the banks of the great 
          Erie Lake, is far cooler. For the Indians coming from India, cool might 
          be a euphemistic expression. To them, it is bitingly cold. Because most 
          of them dress in the traditional Indian dhothy and jibba or sarees, 
          they get very little protection against the cold and blowing wind from 
          the great lakes. However, this is not a story about cold but about warmth 
          - the warmth of human relations and meeting of cultures. <img src="images/Cleveland1.jpg" width="150" height="229" align="right"></font></b></p>
        <p><b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman" color="#003366">It is about 
          5:30 in the evening. It is drizzling outside and the wind is blowing 
          at 30 miles an hour. The temperature is hovering around 25 degrees; 
          frigid and uncomfortable. There is no one around the Comfort Inn lobby 
          other than the lady behind the reception window and I, sitting on one 
          of the sofas in the reception area, stretching my legs before walking 
          back to the auditorium to attend the evening concert. The elevator door 
          opens and a young man, about 25 and of Indian origin gets out of the 
          elevator. He walks directly to the reception window. </font></b></p>
        <p><b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman" color="#003366">The receptionist 
          asks him, &quot;How may I help you?&quot; The young man replies with 
          a strong Indian accent, &quot;The heater in my room is not working. 
          Only the A/C is working and it is making the room even colder.&quot; 
          The receptionist responds, &quot;There is only one knob to operate both 
          the A/C and the heater. You should turn the knob to the left to switch 
          on the heater and to the right to switch on the A/C. Did you turn it 
          to the left?&quot; She continues, explaining how the system works and 
          what the young man should do to turn on the heater. </font></b></p>
        <p><b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman" color="#003366">The Indian 
          young man is having a tough time understanding the Mid-Western slang 
          of the receptionist. Because the young man has a quizzical expression 
          on his face, the receptionist mistakenly assumes that the young man 
          does not understand English. For his part, the young man decides that 
          the lady behind the counter is rambling and is not bright enough to 
          offer a solution to his complaint.</font></b></p>
        <p><b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman" color="#003366">The receptionist 
          decides to add gestures to her spoken words. She stretches her right 
          hand and says &quot;You must turn the knob to the left; to the left.&quot; 
          The young man seeing her stretched right hand and the expression, &quot;turn 
          left&quot; decides this lady is really stupid. The receptionist is extending 
          her right hand because, to the young man who is standing opposite to 
          her, it would point in a left direction. The young man could not take 
          this anymore. He tells the receptionist, &quot;OK. I will try.&quot; 
          He turns around and as he is getting into the elevator, mumbles in one 
          of the Indian languages, &quot;This woman has no common sense. She does 
          not know the difference between left and right. Even the donkey in India 
          is smarter than this woman.&quot; </font></b></p>
        <p><b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman" color="#003366">Another fifteen 
          minutes passes away with nothing eventful happening around the reception 
          area other than a new lady taking over charge behind the reception window. 
          A middle-aged American gentleman and his wife walk in and occupy the 
          two remaining sofas outside the reception area. After a few more minutes, 
          the front door to the hotel opens and a very senior Indian musician 
          clad in a dhothy and jibba and with his head covered by his angavastram 
          like a scarf walks in. He is shivering and tired, having walked from 
          the auditorium to the hotel in the cold and drizzle. </font></b></p>
        <p><b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman" color="#003366">There is no 
          place to sit in the reception area since all three seats were taken. 
          I immediately stand up and offer him my seat. He is very apologetic 
          for taking my seat but is glad that he could sit down. But each time 
          the front door opens, cold air rushes into the reception hall, making 
          the musician shiver violently. Noticing this, the middle-aged American 
          gentleman gets up, walks to the musician and says, &quot;Sir, you should 
          sit away from the front door. You will feel less cold. Let me sit on 
          the sofa closer to the door and you take my seat. You will be more comfortable&quot; 
          The musician gets up with difficulty, moves to the other seat and like 
          a typical Indian elder says to the American gentleman, &quot;You will 
          live long. Andavan will bless you for your good gesture.&quot; The American 
          gentleman could not comprehend the full meaning of what the musician 
          was saying but understood that the musician was blessing him. He turns 
          to the musician and says, &quot;Thank you sir.&quot; Five minutes later, 
          the American gentleman and his wife leave the hotel lobby.</font></b></p>
        <p><b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman" color="#003366">Now, only 
          the senior musician and I are sitting in the reception area. The receptionist 
          turns to the musician and asks him, &quot;Sir, do you want some orange 
          juice? I can get you some.&quot; The musician replies, &quot;No. I do 
          not drink cold items. My father always used to say, drinking cold items 
          is not good for musicians. Your throat will get affected.&quot; The 
          receptionist catches the word &quot;musician&quot; and exclaims, &quot;Sir, 
          are you a musician?&quot; The musician replies,&quot; Yes. I have been 
          a musician for 65 years and I have received several awards and I have 
          even performed before Presidents.' The receptionist grasps the word 
          Presidents. &quot;Wow! You performed before Presidents. Which Presidents 
          did you meet? Roosevelt, Truman, Carter?&quot; The musician replies, 
          &quot;No. Not the American Presidents. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan, Abdul 
          Kalam.&quot; The receptionist has no clue what he is saying.</font></b></p>
        <p><b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman" color="#003366">After attending 
          to a phone call, the receptionist again turns to the musician and says, 
          &quot;My 14 year old daughter is taking singing lessons. She even participates 
          in the school opera. I hope one day she will be a reputed musician like 
          you.&quot; The musician is happy that she is talking about music. The 
          musician responds to the word opera. &quot;Thyagaraja Swamy wrote two 
          great operas - Nowka Charitham and Prahlada Bhakthi Vijayam.&quot; He 
          is addressing no one in particular.</font></b></p>
        <p><b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman" color="#003366">The musician 
          is definitely energized by the conversation about music. The cold and 
          frigid air no longer bothers him. He says,&quot; Ask your daughter to 
          do sadhagam everyday. If she wants to be a good musician, she should 
          do sadhagam everyday. Practice is very important. And, ask her to go 
          to cutcheries regularly. Listening is also very important. I bless your 
          daughter. One day, she will be a great musician and she will receive 
          the Sangeetha Kalanidhi&quot;</font></b></p>
        <p><b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman" color="#003366">The receptionist 
          could not understand what the musician was saying. Sadhagam, cutchery, 
          Nowka Charitham, Prahlada Bhakthi Vijayam, Sangeetha Kalanidhi, words 
          that make no sense. What is he saying? But, she does get the general 
          idea from his gestures and expressions. &quot;I will tell my daughter 
          that a great musician from India said that she should practice everyday. 
          Thank you sir for your advice.&quot; Then she asks him, &quot;Sir, did 
          you learn music in the US?&quot; </font></b></p>
        <p><b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman" color="#003366">The musician 
          replies, &quot;No. No. I was born in Perayoor, a small village in Thanjavur 
          district. It is on the banks of the Cauvery. My father was very strict. 
          He was a vidwan like me. Unless I get up at 4:30 in the morning and 
          practice singing for three hours, he will not allow me to eat my tiffin. 
          A disciplinarian.&quot; The elder musician had already forgotten that 
          he was 12,000 miles away from the banks of the Cauvery and that he is 
          now 80 years old. He has gone back in time to 1930, when he was six 
          years old.</font></b></p>
        <p><b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman" color="#003366">The receptionist 
          also turns to her chores and starts entering data into her computer.</font></b></p>
        <p><b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman" color="#003366">Unlike the 
          young man and the first receptionist who were unable to reconcile the 
          heater problem, language and culture did not stop the elder musician 
          and the second receptionist from having a hearty conversation with each 
          other. When people show compassion and respect to each other and not 
          judge each other -- accent, strange words, and even unrecognized Presidents 
          would not stop them from interacting. They would understand when left 
          is right and when West is East. As companions, they would find a common 
          road to travel.</font></b></p>
