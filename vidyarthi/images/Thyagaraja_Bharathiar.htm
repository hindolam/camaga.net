        <p class=MsoNormal> There has been a long tradition in the relationship 
          between classical Indian music and Hinduism as a religion. Classical 
          composers like Thyagaraja often reflect upon stories from mythology 
          and Hindu scripts like the Ramayana in their music. Similarly the great 
          poet Bharathiar often used images from religious texts to illustrate 
          his poetry. On the surface it seems then that classical music or poetry 
          that speaks about religion is religious in nature. Is not the artist 
          promoting the belief of individual Gods by evoking images of Gods in 
          their music? The answer lies in how deeply we examine the music or poetry 
          itself to understand the message that the artist is conveying through 
          their art. </p>
        <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class=MsoNormal>Artists like Thyagaraja and Bharathiar attempt to use 
          religion as an illustrative tool to convey the wisdom of our ancestors. 
          Images of Gods overcoming tribulations and learning from their mistakes 
          for the betterment of humanity give us humans the sense that we too 
          should live in the image of God. By illustrating the moral conduct of 
          Gods, these artists are conveying the importance of living simple while 
          still searching for a higher objective. In Hindu scripture as well as 
          in classical music and poetry, the belief is that by each of us taking 
          charge of our lives and pursuing valuable goals, we will improve not 
          only ourselves but also our community. </p>
        <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class=MsoNormal>In our modern societies, we tend to believe that it 
          is unrealistic to think that by simply being responsible for our own 
          conduct and in pursuing valuable objectives, the individual attains 
          harmony within himself and his community. How can good conduct and character 
          alone make us happy? Don't we need money, power, and a new flat screen 
          T.V. to have a happy life? Is classical Indian art still relevant when 
          it surmises that an individual can make a difference in the world without 
          money and power? Although these are valid questions, history has shown 
          that the messages of Thyagaraja and Bharathiar are still very relevant 
          in our modern world. A single individual, without money or power, can 
          make a difference to the world just by living their lives with decency 
          and honor. Did not Buddha, Mahatma Gandhi, and Martin Luther King show 
          the world that one individual can make a difference? All three of these 
          great men also lived simply and searched for higher meaning in their 
          lives, thus changing their world in the process. </p>
        <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class=MsoNormal>A character from Hindu mythology that illustrates the 
          importance of good conduct is Ravana. Ravana was the king of Lanka and 
          one of the principle characters from the epic Ramayana. Ravana was a 
          powerful king, enormously wealthy and was protected by a powerful army. 
          He was also a very learned scholar and an accomplished musician who 
          could even charm the God Shiva with his music. Because of his devotion 
          and scholarly accomplishments, Shiva blessed Ravana with fortune. However, 
          despite the power and wealth bestowed upon Ravana, Ravana wanted more. 
          He wanted Sita, the wife of Rama. Even though he was married, Ravana 
          was captivated by the beauty of Sita, and wanted to marry her. To satisfy 
          his desires, Ravana kidnapped Sita and took her to his kingdom. Angered 
          by Ravana's actions, Rama invaded Lanka and with the help of Hanuman 
          and his monkey army, retrieved Sita from Ravana's kingdom. As the rest 
          of the Ramayana describes, eventually Ravana's greed cost him his kingdom, 
          the lives of his brothers, his son, and himself. The story of Ravana 
          has been used by many classical artists to illustrate how a person who 
          behaves immorally will not only destroy himself but also everything 
          around him. </p>
        <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class=MsoNormal>As Ravana's story further illustrates, morals and character 
          are more powerful than money or even blessings from Gods. An individual 
          who has no control over his mind is not going to be saved by religious 
          rituals or by the money in his bank account. In the song, Adigi Sukhamu, 
          poet Thyagaraja writes that getting boons and blessings from God in 
          self-interest is futile. Such blessings always come with a catch. When 
          your moral conduct fails, blessings from God will also fail you. </p>
        <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class=MsoNormal>Thyagaraja, the great musical composer, wrote several 
          songs highlighting this fact and often used Ravana's life to point to 
          the importance of moral conduct. In the song Emi Chesithe nemi, Thyagaraja 
          states that if you are a slave to base thoughts and immoral behavior, 
          acquiring enormous wealth, living in a huge mansion, and being surrounded 
          by attractive and influential people will not save you. When you lack 
          values, even God cannot save you from misery. In the song Manasu Nilpa, 
          Thyagaraja writes performing ritual celebrations or bathing in holy 
          rivers does not purify you if you fill your mind with impure thoughts. 
          Similarly, in the song Manasu Swadheenamaina, Thygaraja points out that 
          a person who keeps his mind under control does not need rituals or rules. 
          Such a person is not distracted by material things and is always happy. 
        </p>
        <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class=MsoNormal>The poet Bharathiar also illustrates the value of living 
          a good life in his poetry. In his imaginary dialogues with gods and 
          goddesses, Bharathiar exclaims "Why do you talk of religion and philosophy 
          when you cannot control your anger or conduct. What you need are mental 
          strength, good thoughts and actions." But more than his poetic expressions 
          about good living, Bharathiar illustrates them by the actions he took 
          in his life. Poet Bharathiar's life shows us that a person can contribute 
          to the welfare of the world even if the person is poor and not wealthy. 
          Bharathiar was born in 1882. Even at a young age, Bharathiar had become 
          a great poet. At the young age of 11, the King of Ettayapuram honored 
          him for his poetic abilities. Bharathiar was not a rich person and had 
          no powerful political connections. He was a schoolteacher earning a 
          low salary and in later years, he also worked as an editor of a Tamil 
          magazine. </p>
        <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class=MsoNormal>Bharathiar grew up in a period when the Indian society 
          was torn by caste struggles and where women were treated as second-class 
          citizens. This period was also characterized by the independence movement 
          as Indians were seeking freedom from the British rule. As a patriot, 
          Bharathiar was opposed to the British rule of India. As a social revolutionary, 
          he was opposed to caste discriminations and the treatment of women. 
          Bharathiar chose to use his powerful poetry and fiery writing to speak 
          out about these two causes. In his poems and articles, he constantly 
          wrote about the greatness of India and urged its people to rise against 
          the British and free India from foreign rule. But he also chastised 
          people for their slave mentality and for fearing the British. His poems 
          and writings energized the people and made them fight against the British 
          using non-violent means. The British were so infuriated by Bharathiar's 
          writings that they eventually put him in prison. However, the prison 
          sentence and harassment by the British did not dissuade Bharathiar from 
          continuing his crusade. </p>
        <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class=MsoNormal>Bharathiar was also upset by the social ills that were 
          widespread in his community. Through his poems and other writing, Bharathiar 
          urged people to refrain from discriminating against others on the basis 
          of caste, color, creed or religion. He wrote, "We are all one and we 
          are Indians first and Tamilians, Kannadigas, Telugus, or Punjabis second." 
          He called people who treated women poorly as "senseless idiots." His 
          writings highlighted the contributions of women and their importance 
          in the society. Unfortunately Bharathiar died at the young age of thirty-nine. 
          He did not live to see India's independence nor its attempt to take 
          control over its social ills. But, Bharathiar did have an impact on 
          both these causes and the legacy that he left behind is still with us. 
        </p>
        <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class=MsoNormal>What we learn from the life and art of Bharathiar and 
          Thyagaraja is that classical music and poetry are about much more than 
          religion. These artists prove that art is a medium through which to 
          convey universal truths about life. Bharathiar's life illustrates that 
          money and power are irrelevant; if you set your goals high and pursue 
          them with vigor, you can make a difference in the world. Thyagaraja's 
          music stresses that by living ethically and rising above the prejudices 
          and discriminations of society is in itself a religious activity. <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-fareast-font-family:
