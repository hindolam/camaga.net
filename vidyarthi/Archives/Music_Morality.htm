          hope our past discussions on music, dance, and other arts have been 
          exciting and fascinating to you. This month I want to share two stories 
          from Hindu mythology. Mythology contains interesting and fictional stories 
          about Gods, people, their beliefs, and traditions. The Ramayana and 
          the Mahabharatha, for example, talk about ordinary people and every 
          day events. These stories teach people that knowledge of our mythology 
          and accomplishments in music are important, while illustrating at the 
          same time, that it is even more important to live our lives with decency 
          and honor. While these are stories of the past, we can relate to them 
          even today and find great meaning in them. </font></b></p>
        <p><font color="#003366" face="Times New Roman"><b>The general belief 
          among Indians is that music is divine and life like. Even Gods are pleased 
          by music. Even today, it is common to recite mantras and other hymns 
          in praise of Gods during Hindu religious ceremonies. Often, these mantras 
          and hymns are recited musically because they are very pleasing to those 
          who are present in the congregation. Also, many of our culture's stories 
          describe some of the Gods and saints as gifted musicians, excellent 
          dancers and learned scholars. For example, Krishna is a flute maestro. 
          Goddess Saraswathi is a Veena player, while Nandi is an accomplished 
          drummer. Shiva and his wife, Parvathi are great dancers. Brahma and 
          Saraswathi are learned, wise scholars. In fact, Saraswathi is also personified 
          as the goddess of wisdom, learning and knowledge. The Gods and saints 
          are not described as musicians or scholars simply to make them appear 
          interesting, however. Through the narrations of reading about the life 
          of these accomplished individuals, we discover the qualities that made 
          them great but also the weaknesses that made them fail.</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#003366" face="Times New Roman"><b>For example, take the 
          story of Saint Narada. Narada, when translated into English, means knowledge 
          giver -- Nara is the word for knowledge and Da means giver. Saint Narada 
          is most known for creating mischief and quarrels between people (although 
          the quarrels always lead to good things and makes everyone happy). Apart 
          from his mischief making, however, Narada is also well known for his 
          supreme musical talents - according to Hindu mythology, he introduced 
          people to the gift of music. Narada always appears with a Veena in his 
          hands and constantly chants the name of Lord Narayana. Even today, In 
          India, when a religious discourse or a Yakshagana (a type of dance-drama 
          or an opera) is held, the programs begin after invoking the name of 
          Narada. </b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#003366" face="Times New Roman"><b>Saint Narada, wasn't 
          without flaws, however. He was proud of his musical skills, but looked 
          down on others who were less skilled than he was. Once he went to the 
          kingdom of Lord Krishna. Krishna knew of Narada's arrogance and wanted 
          to teach him a lesson on modesty and respect for others. Krishna asked 
          Narada to play his Veena before an assembled audience in his court. 
          Narada played the Veena brilliantly and delighted the audience with 
          his music. At the end of his performance, Narada turned to Krishna and 
          waited for the God to express his appreciation of Narada's music. Krishna, 
          instead, turned to Hanuman, the monkey God, who was sitting in the audience, 
          and asked him what he thought of Narada's music. Narada, unaware of 
          Hanuman's divine status, was very unhappy that Krishna, instead of expressing 
          his appreciation, sought the opinion of a mere monkey. &quot;What does 
          a monkey know about music?&quot; Narada thought. <br>
          </b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#003366" face="Times New Roman"><b>Krishna reading the 
          mind of Narada said, &quot;Oh Narada, I understand your concern, but 
          first, let us find out if this monkey really knows anything about music. 
          Give him your Veena and let him play it.&quot; Narada became even angrier 
          because musicians consider their musical instruments sacred. Narada 
          didn't want to share his Veena with anyone, especially not a monkey. 
          He couldn't refuse Krishna's request however, and reluctantly handed 
          the Veena to Hanuman. Hanuman began to play the Veena and sang beautiful 
          hymns in praise of Lord Rama. The Monkey God's singing and playing was 
          so sincere and so devoted that the entire audience was mesmerized. Even 
          the great musical genius Narada was compelled to appreciate Hanuman's 
          music. Being a person of enormous wisdom, Narada began to realize the 
          lesson that Krishna was teaching him. Narada asked Krishna's forgiveness 
          for not respecting the greatness of Hanuman and for underestimating 
          Hanuman because he was a monkey. </b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#003366" face="Times New Roman"><b>Like the story of Narada, 
          the myth of Ravana also illustrates the importance of good conduct and 
          morality over mere accomplishments in music or education. Ravana, the 
          mighty demon king of Lanka is one of the principal characters from the 
          Ramayana. Like Narada, Ravana was very talented in music and also very 
          learned and knowledgeable in the Vedas and the scriptures. He was an 
          ardent devotee of Lord Shiva and enchanted Shiva with his music (Shiva 
          is called &quot;Gana Priya&quot;, one who is pleased by music). One 
          day, delighted by the demon king's music, Lord Shiva granted him a wish: 
          Ravana desired that his life could only be ended by Shiva and by no 
          other Gods. As the years passed, Ravana acquired enormous powers through 
          his penance and through the wish granted by Shiva. But, instead of using 
          his powers and his knowledge of music and the Vedas to benefit the world, 
          Ravana used them to only benefit himself. He became very proud, conceited, 
          and even immoral. </b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#003366" face="Times New Roman"><b>According to the Ramayana, 
          Ravana kidnapped Sita, Rama's wife and tried to take her for his own. 
          To rescue his wife from Ravana, Rama, invaded Lanka. But Ravana was 
          unconcerned, confident that he was too powerful to be killed by Rama. 
          Alas, he didn't realize that Shiva only exempted him from being killed 
          by Gods, but not human beings. Since Rama was a human incarnation of 
          Vishnu, Shiva's boon could not save Ravana. He died at Rama's hands. 
          </b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#003366" face="Times New Roman"><b>We can learn a great 
          deal from the stories of Narada and Ravana. The Narada story shows that 
          even great saints and learned scholars occasionally make mistakes or 
          act foolish. Regardless of one's accomplishments in music, art, or education, 
          one must be modest and simple and never underestimate the talents of 
          others. More importantly, we must learn, like Narada, that no one, not 
          even great Saints, can judge people based on their color, appearance, 
          or origin. Finally, even great saints can admit when they are wrong. 
          </b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#003366" face="Times New Roman"><b>Ravana's story tells 
          us that having musical talents or knowledge of scriptures isn't adequate. 
          We must also live a life of austerity and simplicity. We must not always 
          pursue our own interests, but must also work toward the welfare of the 
          community and world in which we live. Like Ravana, we must learn that 
          a person does not become powerful because of birth, wealth, or possessions. 
          Even the most powerful will become powerless if they violate ethics 
          and morals.</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#003366" face="Times New Roman"><b>Hindu mythology is 
          intended to help us see ourselves more clearly by depicting the lives 
          of Gods and Saints in everyday situations. By reading their stories, 
          we can learn from the mistakes made by these characters as well as the 
          lessons that they learn from them. In this way, we can use these stories 
          as a way to examine our own lives and see how we can make our world 
          and ourselves better. <br>
