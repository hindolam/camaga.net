        <p><o:p> <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b><font color="#0000CC">The 
          year is 1980. I was a graduate student in Texas. My friend Pankaj and 
          I were walking back from our classes to our apartment and waiting to 
          cross the road near the University. A pick up truck pulled right in 
          front of us. The man sitting on the passenger side of the pickup truck 
          rolled down the window and spat at us while the driver shouted at us, 
          &quot;Iranians, go home. We do not want you in this country.&quot; Around 
          this period, terrorists in Iran had held over 50 Americans as hostages 
          for over a year and the Americans were terribly angry at Iranians for 
          humiliating them. </font></b></font></o:p></p>
        <p><o:p></o:p><font color="#0000CC"><b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Although 
          I was shocked by the behavior of the man in the pick up truck, I did 
          not lose my temper and ttried to reason with the man and offered an 
          explanation that we were not who he thought we were. &quot;I am sorry&quot; 
          I said, &quot;You are mistaken. We are not Iranians. We are from India.&quot; 
          The passenger made a threatening gesture and remarked,&quot;Iran, India. 
          Who cares! You are all the same.&quot; My friend, Pankaj was so angered 
          by this unprovoked attack that he grabbed a rock and tried to throw 
          it through the windshield of the truck. I grabbed Pankaj and said, &quot;No. 
          Don't stoop to his level. Control yourself. You don't know what people 
          like this are capable of.&quot; Although Pankaj was visibly shaking 
          with anger, he dropped the stone at my request and we crossed the road 
          and walked back to our apartments in silence. We soon forgot the incident 
          and carried on with our daily lives. <img src="images/Ganges3.jpg" width="172" height="101" align="left"></font></b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#0000CC"><b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">This 
          is not a story of racial prejudice, ignorance or mistaken identity but 
          one of self-control. Throughout life, we all come across situations 
          that upset us and that may provoke us to retaliate violently. In many 
          of these situations, we are completely justified in getting upset. Say 
          for instance, one of your classmates makes fun of your clothes, calls 
          you shorty or fatty and bullies you every day. Your natural instinct 
          is to get angry and hurt the person and take revenge for embarrassing 
          you. &quot;I hate John. I want to break his nose. I want him to fall 
          off his bike and break his legs.&quot; These feelings are natural expressions 
          of being hurt and angry. But to act on these feelings is to let your 
          emotions control who you are. </font></b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#0000CC"><b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Anger 
          is not a physical act but something that manifests from feelings of 
          being treated wrongly. When you repeat the thought, &quot;I hate John&quot; 
          a few times, your feelings of hatred grow stronger and more sinister 
          and dangerous. Once you let your mind escape from you like this, you 
          cannot escape from the path of anger. And once you indulge in that anger 
          by acting on it, you soon lose control of rationality. But everyday 
          life is full of reasons to get angry. My car broke down, my neighbor 
          stole my paper, and there is never any good news on T.V. We cannot possibly 
          lead a good life if we chose to react to every impediment that life 
          throws our way. </font></b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#0000CC"><b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Living 
          a happy life requires making a conscious decision not to react angrily 
          to the taunting of a bully or a redneck or the neighbor. What makes 
          it easier to control our anger in these situations is to question our 
          anger before we act on it. I asked myself all those years ago &quot;why 
          get angry because of this redneck's ignorance. He doesn't even know 
          the difference between an Indian and an Iranian. His anger obviously 
          has nothing to do with who I am as a person so I shouldn't waste time 
          qualifying his racism with a reaction.&quot; <br>
          <br>
          Had Pankaj acted on his anger and thrown a rock through the truck window, 
          he would surely have caused more harm than good. It is safe to assume 
          that someone who slurs hatred at a couple of students for no apparent 
          reason would likely react violently to having his windshield broken. 
          And there is no doubt that neither party would have walked away from 
          the scene unharmed. But by controlling his anger, Pankaj and I were 
          able to walk away with our pride and all of our bones intact. </font></b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#0000CC"><b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Your 
          feelings are like the River Ganges. The Ganges starts on the Himalayan 
          Mountains and as it flows down, it gains speed. When it is uncontrolled, 
          the Ganges runs down with tremendous force and destroys everything in 
          its path - houses, people, and animals. Where it is controlled and channeled, 
          it flows smoothly through a riverbed. It is calm and beautiful and creates 
          life within it that nourishes the people and animals that live along 
          its banks. Feelings like anger, prejudice, and hatred are somewhat like 
          the Ganges. When you let these feelings run wild like the Ganges River, 
          you destroy everything - your enemies, your friends, and your family. 
          It does not differentiate Iranians from Indians. When you find a way 
          to control these emotions, you will be like the serene Ganges - calm, 
          nurturing and inviting.</font></b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#0000CC"><b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Let's 
          look at the Hindu epics and scriptures - they are replete with stories 
          that illustrate how anger can negatively affect your life. Let us reflect 
          on two stories: one from the Mahabharatha and one from the Ramayana.</font></b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#0000CC"><b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The 
          two main families from the Mahabharatha are the Pandavas and the Kauravas. 
          The Pandava brothers were: Yudishtra, Bheema, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva. 
          The Kaurava family consisted of 100 brothers and the eldest among them 
          was Duryodhana. The Pandavas and the Kauravas were cousins. Bheema, 
          one of the Pandava brothers was an enormously powerful person and as 
          a youngster, he used to tease the other boys and bully them into fighting 
          with him. He always won. Like many of the bullies in schools today, 
          Bheema always ridiculed the losers and humiliated them. Duryodhana, 
          the Kaurava cousin of Bheema, was often angered by Bheema's arrogance. 
          Duryodhana hated Bheema so much that he vowed revenge against Bheema 
          and wanted to humiliate Bheema's rich and powerful brothers. As the 
          rest of the Mahabharatha story tells us, Duryodhana eventually conspired 
          with Sakuni, a master crook, and defeated the Pandava brothers in a 
          card game. The Pandavas lost all their property including the kingdom, 
          during the card game and were banished to the forest. After several 
          years, the Pandavas returned to the kingdom, fought the Kaurvas in a 
          battle and regained their kingdom. During the battle, Duryodhana was 
          killed by Bheema All the Kaurava brothers perished during the battle. 
          </font></b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#0000CC"><b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">While 
          Duryodhana was able to hurt his enemy, in the process of acting on his 
          hatred for Bheema by inflicting revenge on the Pandava's, he not only 
          destroys his enemies but also his own family. The lesson in this story 
          is, don't be a bully like Bheema even when you are winning. Be magnanimous. 
          Being a hateful person will only bring misfortune on you and your family. 
          But don't be like Duryodhana either. If you carry a grudge, even against 
          a bully, you may bring more misfortune on yourself.</font></b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#0000CC"><b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The 
          Ramayana is another great Hindu epic. The principle character of the 
          Ramayana is Rama, the son of Dasaratha, the King of Ayodhya. When Rama 
          was a young lad, he used to practice archery in the palace gardens with 
          his brothers. Sometimes, the young and impetuous Rama, used to shoot 
          little clay balls at Kooni, a maid to his stepmother, Kaikeyi. Kooni 
          was a hunchback and Rama aimed the clay balls at the arched back of 
          Kooni and laughed when the clay balls hit Kooni's back and she winced 
          with pain. Kooni was angered by Rama's behavior and vowed to get revenge 
          on him one day.</font></b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#0000CC"><b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">As 
          years went by, Rama grew up and became a person of exemplary character 
          and conduct. King Dasaratha eventually decided to handover the throne 
          to Rama and crown Rama as the king of Ayodhya. Kooni had waited all 
          these years for this day to take her revenge. Kooni was a confidant 
          of Kaikeyi, the stepmother of Rama. Kooni asked Kaikeyi to fulfill promises 
          that her husband Dasaratha gave her when they were married so that Kaikeyi's 
          son Bharatha would become the king instead of Rama and Rama would be 
          sent to the forest so that he can no longer rule Ayodhya. Dasaratha 
          was compelled to obey these two promises. Accordingly, Bharatha was 
          crowned as the king of Ayodhya and Rama was sent to the forest for the 
          next fourteen years. </font></b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#0000CC"><b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">When 
          Dasaratha informed Rama of his promises to Kaikeyi and asked Rama to 
          execute them, Rama, the man of character and highest values, did so 
          without hesitation. Rama gladly relinquished his rights to the kingdom 
          and left to the forest. As the Ramayana further illustrates, Rama finally 
          returned to the kingdom after fourteen years of exile and ruled with 
          glory and greatness. Unlike most of us, Rama did not get angry or upset 
          that his legitimate right to the kingdom was taken away. Instead, Rama 
          patiently accepted the misery with a smile and did not allow jealousy, 
          anger, or hatred to consume him. That is, Rama exhibited the highest 
          of values and ideal conduct. The message of this story is, even the 
          most revered Rama made mistakes when he was growing up. But, he also 
          recognized his failings and developed values that made him a great person.

        <p align="left"><font color="#0000CC"><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">As 
          the stories from the Mahabharatha and the Ramayana illustrate, people

          lives, but also the lives of those around them. They were like the uncontrolled 
          and furious Ganges. On the contrary, people who knew to channel their 
          feelings brought glory to themselves and brought happiness and prosperity 
          to everyone around them. They were like the serene Ganges. </font></b></font></p>
