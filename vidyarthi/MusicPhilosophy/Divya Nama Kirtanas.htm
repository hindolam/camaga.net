color:black'>Of the Nava Vidha Bhakthis or the Nine Paths of Devotion to
Godhead, perhaps the best understood, widely practiced and most enjoyed, is
KIRTANAM.  Singing one’s way to salvation was practiced long before Sri
Thyagaraja Swami’s days.  The Nayanmars and Alwars, preached and practiced this
Marga or path to salvation.  We have it on the authority of scholars like Dr.
S. Ramanathan that Thevaram and Divya Prabhanda hymns were sung to raga and
tala and not merely recited as poetry.  To this day, the Oduvars of the Saivite
School and the Adhyapakas of the Vaishnavite school, sing the Thevarams and
Divya Prabhandams, as part of the temple rituals.  Hymns have been composed by
various saints and savants, on their Ishta Devathas, songs in praise of Lord
Muruga by Arunagirinathaar known as Thiruppugazh, in praise of the Lord of the
Seven Hills by Annamacharya, in praise of Purandaravittala by Purandara Dasa,
in praise of Lord Rama by Bhadrachala Ramadasa and in praise of Lord Krishna by
Narayana Thirtha continue to be part of any bhajans; all of them composed
before the time of Sri Thyagaraja Swami.  </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:115%;
color:black'>Bhaja means the worshipping of God or praying to God, singing His
praise.  This form of Bhakthi was an important part of the daily worship by the
Bhagavathas.  Members of the public joined in at these Bhajans, repeating the
verses and singing in chorus, both at the Uncha Vritti on the streets and at
the gathering in the temple.  One Divya Nama Kirtana of the Sadguru in Yamuna
Kalyani describes the Haridasas setting out on their Uncha Vritti Bhajan on the
streets.  “Watching the Haridasas getting out on their Bhajan fills our heart
with delight.  With their waist bands tied well, with metallic cymbals in their
hands, with the musical gosham of the mridangams, with Gnana, Rama Dhyana and
sweet music, surrendering themselves wholeheartedly to the Lord, and watching
them go on the streets fills the heart with delight.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:115%;
color:black'>Sri Thyagaraja Swami, being a Bhagavatha in the Bhakthi Marga,
strongly believed that music and devotion combined, represented the easiest,
sweetest and certain path to the attainment of Jeevan Mukthi or liberation from
the cycle of birth and death.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><u><span

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:115%;
color:black'>On his reasons for composing the Divyanama Keertanas, Thyagaraja
Swami, in his kriti, “Raga Ratna Malika” in Ritigowla, says “As the sole means
of my salvation, with the authority of all Scriptures, as the path to happiness
of all Yogis and for all Bhagavathas to sing together, I composed these songs. 
Come let us sing these together and attain all Sowbhagya.”  Collectively a set
of songs composed by Thyagaraja Swami as an expression of bhakthi and bhajana
tradition came to be known as Divya Nama Kirtanas.  </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:115%;
color:black'>There are some 78 kirtanas that are in the group of keertanas
called Divyanama Keertanas. These keertanas are meant for group singing. they
are generally in the &quot;lambaka&quot; style with one pallavi and a series of
charanams with the &quot;dathu&quot; or tune to facilitate repetition on choral
singing. In theme and structure, they are varied. The keertanas are composed on
a wide variety of popular ragas such as Todi, Sankarabharanam, Karaharapriya
and Saveri, and less well known ragas such as Andhali, Ahiri, and Balahamsa.
Even in the rarer ragas, these songs have a simple structure and so anyone with
an ear for music can very quickly learn and join in the singing.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><u><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:115%;color:black'>THE RAMAYANA THEME</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:115%;
color:black'>Mostly the divyanama keertana themes are based on the Ramayana but
as pointed out earlier, there are also songs on human conduct. All important
incidents in Srimad Ramayana are narrated in sequence, from Viswamitra
Yagasamarakshna to pattabishekam, in the kirtana “Vinayamunanu” in
Sowrashtram.  The unique beauty of this composition is its poetic excellence. 
Parayaya Namas or Synonyms for hands, feet, eyes, etc., is employed to narrate
the stories.  The translation of the two Charanams to explain this point is
given hereunder and it is suggested to interested readers to read the complete
song and its translation from a book by Swami’s kirtanas.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:115%;
color:black'>“When will I see the feet that marched with Viswamitra, when will
I see the feet that brought Vimochana to Ahalya, when do I see the foot that
pressed down the Siva Dhanus at the Swayamvara of Sita, when do I see the feet
that Janaka washed with milk at his daughter’s wedding, when will I see the
hands which tied the mangala sutra to Sita, when will I see the hands which
took the strength of Parasurama, when will I see the hands which killed Virada
and when will I see the hands which gave abhaya to the rishis in the forest?” 
In this manner, the story of Ramayana is taken from Bala Kanda to Aranya Kanda
using synonyms.  The singing of this song will be the singing of the whole of
Ramayana and so this song is referred to as Samkahepa Ramayana or condensed
Ramayana.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:115%;
color:black'>In The kirtana “Pahirama” in Kharaharapriya, each stanza is
devoted to one of the members of Rama’s  parivara or entourage and we are told
how Rama gave happiness to Sita with his words, to Lakshmana with his eyes, to
Bharata with his embrace, to Sathrugna with his nod of approval and to Anjaneya
with praise.  This song is full of raghabhava and bring out, within the
limitations of a kirtana without sangatis, the nuances of this rakthi raga.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:115%;
color:black'>As an example of this, the Yadukula Kambhoji composition “Sri
Rama, Jaya Rama” in khanda chapu may be cited.  Starting with Kausalya and
wandering what great penance she had performed to earn the privilege of being
able to kiss the lovely cheeks of Sri Rama, Dasaratha, Sowmitri, Kowsika,
Ahalya, Janaka, Sita and Narada are all mentioned in the same manner,
mentioning the joy they got out of Rama.  Incidentally, the arrangement of the
episodes and characters is such that this composition also narrates Ramayana
from Yaga Rakshanam to Sita Kalyanam.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><u><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:115%;color:black'>TRUE BHAKTHA</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:115%;
color:black'>The song “Karuna Jaladhe” in Nadnamakriya lists the qualities of a
true bhaktha after mentioning that the experience of a true bhaktha is totally
different from the findings of one who does not know Rama.  The song lists the
various sections of a true bhaktha, which ensure his constant thought of Rama
and his presence with the devotee.  In the last charana, Swami refers to the
advaitic experience, which comes to a devotee practicing for long and Bhakthi
marga.  “Neevanni teyani Balkudure, Neeve Thannani Kulgukudure.”  They (the
true devotees) will find and speak of you of you being everything and they
themselves being you.”  What a worthwhile reward for a waiting bhaktha?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><u><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:115%;color:black'>HUMAN FOIBLE</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:115%;
color:black'>Listing the commonly occurring misconducts and weaknesses of man,
in the kirtana “Rama Rama Krishnayanare” in Gowlipanthu, Swami says that even
the worst sinners are known to have changed for the better and attained
salvation by singing the name of the Lord.  “Kaani Panulu Kori Kori,
karanguchundu Nannavulu” and “Challani Vakulu Balki Swanthaamanalamaina Varu”
meaning that those who hanker for things that are not right and to which are
not entitled and those who speak with honey on their tongue but with fire in
their hearts, even they will reform and benefit by singing Rama, Rama, Krishna.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><u><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:115%;color:black'>Manasika Puja</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:115%;
color:black'>One can go on and on giving examples of the beauty, wisdom and
music of these priceless gems have to offer.  Let us be contented with one
final example of Swami’s stress on purity of thought, unselfishness and
un-attachment to fruits of worship, by quoting the kirtana “Paripalaya
Paripalaya” in Reetigowlai “O: God, my pure body is your temple; my sthira or
nischala chithha (unwavering) is the peeta or asana for you; my pure thoughts
are Ganga water for your abhisheka; my devotion is the golden cloth for you to
wear.  The burning away of the fruits of my past evil deeds is the sambrani
dhoopam.  My happiness which cannot be separated is the thamboolam for you and
so on.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:115%;
color:black'>The list of such songs and their themes is long and I suggest that
those who are interested may go through the textgs and authentic translation
for further study. It is for this very purpose of giving the interested student
and scholar a more comprehensive coverage; to enable even those not taking part
in the singing, to appreciate the superb concepts enshrined in the divyanama
keertanas that, for the first time ever, Sri T. S. Parthasarathy has included
in his book of Thyagaraja kritis, a word for word translation.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:115%;
color:black'>It may be added here that the late Dr. R. Krishnaswami of Glaxo
Labs was also, in no mean measure, responsible for the successful publication
of this book. In 1967, the 200th Jayanthi Aradhana of Sri Thyagaraja Swami was
celebrated all over the country. At this time, Dr. Krishnaswami, a great and
ardent devotee of the Saint, was very keen on the publication of an authentic
version of the Swami's composition by <a href="Sadguru_Sangeetha_Samajam.htm">Sri
Sadguru Sangeetha Samajam,</a> Purasawalkam, Chenni. It was greatly due to his
tireless endeavors that this publication was brought out, on the Aradhana day
in 1967 (First edition). A second edition was brought out in 1972. This information
has been added on Dr. R. K's contribution after his passing away in June, 1991.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:115%;
color:black'>My request: do not put away to another day the joy or reading,
listening to or singing those musical gems.  It is impossible to convey the
happiness which can come from the singing of these songs.  An essay on sugar
cannot convey the sweetness of sugar.  You have to taste it yourself.  In his
composition “Anandam Anandamaye” in Bhairavi, the Swami says “Even Brahma,
Indira and Siva cannot express in words all the happiness they experience; Who
am I, a poor mortal with a very limited vocabulary?”</span></b></p>
