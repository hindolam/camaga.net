  <p class=MsoNormal><font size="+3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Thyagaraja 
    Swami, in his compositions, often uses words and proverbs which are not strictly 
    in accordance with the Telugu language or its grammar.  This often brings 
    criticism of Swami's grammar. For example, he uses the expression, &quot;Tholi 
    Nenu Jeyu Pooja,&quot; instead of Toli Nenu Jesina Pooja&quot; instead of 
    using the words, &quot;Toli nenu jesina Pooja.&quot; He uses Kechana, where 
    Kachin has to be used (Yochana, Durbar). But, using these expressions with 
    much effect on the entire song or verse is the privilege of great poets. If 
    Shakespeare is allowed mixed metaphors and double superlatives, why not Swami 
    be allowed these minor transgressions in grammar?</span></b></font></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><font size="+3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Many 
    more examples of Swami's poetic skill can be pointed out to highlight the 
    point that he not only composed songs on deities but on nature and its beauty 
    as well. Apart from the two kritis mentioned earlier in the context of his 
    description of the Yamuna theera in Nowka Charitram and his choornika with 
    Vaikunta varana in Prahlada Bhakthi Vijayam, we can also mention Anupama Gunambhudi 
    Kanakapala dhara nannu gana kapata mela, etc. He however is seems to rhyme 
    Sudha with Katha, Dasaratha with Dayasradha, the tha dha rhyming being a common 
    fallacy noticeable in colloquial Telugu.</span></b></font></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><font size="+3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Emotions: 
    To justify his being hailed as one of the foremost poets of his time, Swami 
    has brilliantly captured all rasas in his compositions. Many people think 
    that studying Swami's kritis means only listening to long faced and serious 
    aphorisms and homilies. Few know that he has used Sringara (Romance), Soka 
    (Sorrow), Saantha (Tranquil, Peace), and Haasya (Humor)with equal felicity. 
    Before him and indeed even after his time, Mukhari was used only for the sokha 
    rasa; but Swami proved that this need not be so, by using Mukhari to produce 
    Haasya in the kriti, Chinthisthunaade Yamudu, whose dhathu, Sri Gopalakrishna 
    Bharathi adopted for his Chidambara darisanam. The description of the dowwarika 
    in the music drama, Prahlada Bhakthi Vijayam, is full of hasya. &quot;Mati 
    Mariki meesamu duvvi, manmatha roopudu thanani krovvi, dati dati paduchuna&quot; 
    is hilarious. One scholar studying the Nowka charithram and in particular 
    the criticism by some purists about the excessively sringara rasa ra in this 
    drama, says that Sri Swami has walked the razor edge in keeping strictly in 
    ethical and moral values and his sringara rasa, unlike that of Jayadeva, has 
    not stepped outside the canons of decency. Whatever the rasa employed, the 
    ultimate objective is Bhakthi and rasas have been employed only to emphasize 
    the need for Bhakthi. </span></b></font></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><font size="+3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Philosophy: 
    Practically, every school of philosophy has claimed Swami as its votary. Citing 
    Swami's later day kritis such as Gnanamosoga rada in Poorvikalyani and Paramatmudu 
    in Vagadheeswari, the &quot;dvaitis claim his.&quot; The Visishtaadvatis claim 
    him citing kritis such as Bhuvini dasudane in Sriranjani, where the Sri Vedanta 
    Desikan's Panchanga Prapatti is virtually reproduced. The Marjara Nyaya school 
    quotes the Bhairavi kriti, Tananayuni Brova in support of their claiming Swami 
    as one of them. Sri Swami himself has been asked the question, whether he 
    should follow one or the other margas; but, Swami, never answered it. E dari 
    sancharintur in Kanthamani and Dwaitamu Sukhama in Riti Gowla clearly tell 
    us that the answer to the question is not easy. Indeed, he has clearly mentioned 
    that the pathway to Godhead is a matter of individual preference and the label 
    is inconsequential. &quot;Vaga Vadaja buja iyinche variki tripthiaoureethi 
    saguna dhyanamu paini sowkhyamu.&quot; Like the satisfaction after a meal 
    is wholly an individual affair and no one meal being the cause of universal 
    satisfaction, philosophical path is a matter of personal choice and preference. 
    His main stress is on morals and ethics, humility and non-attachment or unattachment 
    or Thyaga.</span></b></font></p>
