<p><font size="5">This short biography is only for the benefit of those not familiar 
  with the details of Thyagaraja Swami's life story. He was born on the 4th of 
  May 1767 and died on January 7th, 1847. Thanks to our imprecise recording of 
  history, there is doubt about the place in which he was born. Most people believe 
  he was born in Thiruvaroor. But, one foreign student of Swami doubts this. He 
  points out that it is the custom to name the first born of the family after 
  the presiding deity of the place and if Thyagaraja was indeed been born in Thiruvaroor 
  the eldest son, Panchapakesan, would have been named Thyagaraja. It is also 
  pointed out that Ramanathapuram Srinivasa Iyengar has in his song in praise 
  of Swami says that he was born in Thiruvayyar. We shall however have to leave 
  it there for now.</font></p>
<p><font size="5">Thyagaraja Swami had two brothers. Swami's father, Sri Ramabrahmam, 
  trained Swami in ritual worship and taught him the sastras and puranas. Pothana's 
  Bhagavatham was one of the granthas used for daily parayanam. For a short time, 
  Swami learnt music under the court musician Sonti Venkatasubbiah and his son, 
  Sonti Venkatramanayya. No direct descendants of the Swami are now alive. He 
  married twice and had one daughter who died without children of her own. Both 
  on the father's side and mother's side, there were well known musicians and 
  Vidwans and it is said that from his grandfather, Giri Raja Kavi, he acquired 
  rare musical treatise, such as the Sangeetha Ratnakara, the Sangraha Choodamani, 
  and the mythical Swararnavam (distinct from the book of that name now available).</font></p>
<p><font size="5">There are many legends which attribute quite a few miracles 
  as having been performed by Swami. Such legends are naturally interpolated, 
  at least some of them apocryphal, added over the years but do have their use 
  in presenting an interesting life story of a great individual. It is not this 
  aspect which is of interest to us now. What he preached is what he practiced, 
  i.e., eschewing the emotional and character weaknesses - Kama, kroda, lobha, 
  moha, mada, and matsarya - but, practicing sama, dama, uparati, titiksha, saraddha, 
  and samadana. In other words, he showed us that we must get rid of desire, lust, 
  selfishness, ego, jealousy, hatred, and fear and cultivate self control, equanimity, 
  tranquility, ability to bear suffering and look away from evil. Hence, what 
  we should remember and base ourselves on, are his steadfast determination to 
  stick to the path of truth and virtue for &quot;their&quot; own sake and not 
  for fame, comfort, and vanity.</font></p>
