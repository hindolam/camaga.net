      mathematical physicist Pierre de Leplace, the man who told Napoleon that 
      he "had no need of this hypothesis" when discussing God's action in the 
      Newtonian universe, realized that, if all motion is mathematically determined, 
      then the present state of motion of the universe suffices to fix its future 
      (and past) for all time. In this case, time becomes virtually redundant, 
      for the future is already contained in the present, in the sense that all 
      the information needed to create the future states of the universe resides 
      in the present state. As the Belgian chemist Ilya Prigogine once poetically

      have entered via your sense organs at different times), such as the sight 
      of the flame, or the smell of burning wood. This complex coherent representation 
      involving objects or events and their properties will be the representation 
      of a burning fire. Yet once this information is cognitively available to 
      us, the moment that gave rise to it, and everything that happened during 
      that moment, is already a thing of the past. When trying to connect with 
      the present moment, we face the same situation as someone looking at a distant
