      wished to make an account of religion, I believe I would tend toward the 
      Feuerbachian view that religion is a human projection of humanity's conceptions

      by understanding it as structured around and mirroring back these values. 
      Then it would resemble art, with which it is strongly associated. But this 
      would dignify religion and characterize the mind as outwardly and imaginatively

    <li><b><font color="#000000">Although the [Aboriginal] Dream Time carries 
      connotations of a heroic past age, it is wrong to think of that age as now 
      over. "One cannot 'fix' The Dreaming in time," observes [anthropologist 
      W.E.H.] Skinner. "It was, and is, everywhere." Thus the Dreaming retains 
      a relevance in contemporary aboriginal affairs, because it is a part of 
      the present reality; the "creator beings" are still active today. What Europeans 
      call "the past" is, for many aboriginal people, both past and present. … 
      for the Australian aborigine, events are more important than dates. (Paul

      who used this elusive notion as one of the basic building blocks of their 
      theory, and miraculously, the theory worked. When one of the leading figures 
      of the clan, by the name of Albert Einstein, quietly mumbled his secret 
      incantation which sounded like "Combine time with space in such a way that 
      nothing can travel faster than the speed of light, then mass is equal to 
      energy," lo and behold, atoms exploded ever so noisily. (Japanese philosopher

    <li><font color="#000000"><b>Despite all its subjective importance, we do 
      not ever seem to experience the present moment. The processing of neural 
      information takes time. If you feel the warmth of the fire with your hand, 
      this perception has to travel from a particular part of your skin along 
      various neural pathways up your arm, through your body, until it finally 
      reaches the brain. Once the information about the temperature has arrived 
      there, it is integrated with various other pieces of information (that may 
      have entered via your sense organs at different times), such as the sight 
      of the flame, or the smell of burning wood. This complex coherent representation 
      involving objects or events and their properties will be the representation 
      of a burning fire. Yet once this information is cognitively available to 
      us, the moment that gave rise to it, and everything that happened during 
      that moment, is already a thing of the past. When trying to connect with 
      the present moment, we face the same situation as someone looking at a distant 
      star, the light of which still reaches his eyes, while the star itself has 
      long ceased to be. The time scale involved here is obviously much shorter, 
      but the fundamental point remains the same." (Jan Westerhoff, philosopher

      by quality, for it is without qualities; nor yet by activity because it 
      is without activity - &quot;at rest, without parts or activity,&quot; according 
      to the Scriptures. Neither can it be denoted by relationship, for it is 
      &quot;without a second&quot; and is not the object of anything but its own
