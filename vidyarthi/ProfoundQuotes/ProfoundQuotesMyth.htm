    <li><b><font color="#000000">Although the [Aboriginal] Dream Time carries

      over. "One cannot 'fix' The Dreaming in time," observes [anthropologist 
      W.E.H.] Skinner. "It was, and is, everywhere." Thus the Dreaming retains 
      a relevance in contemporary aboriginal affairs, because it is a part of 
      the present reality; the "creator beings" are still active today. What Europeans 
      call "the past" is, for many aboriginal people, both past and present. … 
      for the Australian aborigine, events are more important than dates. (Paul

      sin, Satan and salvation are religious myths. Ideas such as soverignity, 
      nation state, human rghts, women's rights, animal rights and gay rights 
      are secular myths. Religious or secular, all myths make profound sense to 
      one group of people. Not to everyone. They cannot be rationalized beyond
