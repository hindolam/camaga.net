    <li><b><font color="#000000">If I were not myself a religious person, but 
      wished to make an account of religion, I believe I would tend toward the 
      Feuerbachian view that religion is a human projection of humanity's conceptions 
      of beauty, goodness, power, and other valued things, a humanizing of experience 
      by understanding it as structured around and mirroring back these values. 
      Then it would resemble art, with which it is strongly associated. But this 
      would dignify religion and characterize the mind as outwardly and imaginatively 
      engaged with the world, as, in parascientific thought after Comte, it never 
      is. (Marilynne Robinson, American novelist and essayist) </font></b>
