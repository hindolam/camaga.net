        <p class=MsoNormal><font color="#000033"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Recently, 
          the Carnatic Music Association of Georgia located in Atlanta celebrated 
          the annual Great Composers' Day to celebrate the memories of eminent 
          music composers of India. A most fulfilling outcome of the day was the 
          talent exhibited by young people growing up in this country. Their performances 
          showed the immense interest the youngsters have for our great music 
          and our traditions. Equally admirable is the excellent training and 
          guidance that the gurus have provided to these young people. This experience 
          made me think about the value of the guru-shishya relationship. </font></b></font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font color="#000033"><b><font face="Times New Roman"><br>
          The word &quot;guru&quot;means, one who dispels darkness or enlightens. 
          &quot;Gu&quot; means darkness or lack of knowledge and &quot;ru&quot; 
          means one who throws light and dispels the darkness. In simple words, 
          a guru is a teacher; someone who guides an individual to learn something. 
          The learning could be about music, painting, writing or simple values 
          of life. Therefore, an individual would have many gurus during the course 
          of a lifetime and the gurus themselves may come in many forms. </font></b></font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font color="#000033"><b><font face="Times New Roman"><br>
          The following story illustrates why we need many gurus and how they 
          come in many forms. Long time ago, a King was passing through a forest 
          followed by his entourage of soldiers carrying arms and his servants 
          carrying jewelry and other ornaments. Suddenly they came upon an old 
          man lying in the middle of the forest, clad only in a loincloth, laughing 
          merrily and appearing enormously happy. The old man had no possessions 
          and yet seemed quite content with life. The King, with all his possessions, 
          had never been this happy and wanted to know the secret of the old man's 
          happiness. The King got out of his chariot and approached the old man 
          lying on the forest floor. The old man took no notice of the King or 
          his entourage. The King, however, did not take the elder man ignoring 
          his presence as an insult. Instead, the king approached the elderly 
          man with respect and asked him, &quot;Why are you so happy? You have 
          no possessions or a comfortable place to live and yet, you seem to be 
          content and satisfied. What is the secret of your happiness? Revered 
          sir! Would you let me know who your guru is so that I can also receive 
          guidance from him on the secret to happiness.&quot; The old man turned 
          to the King and said, &quot;Oh King! I have had 20 gurus. My gurus include 
          this body, this earth, the birds, the animals, and the trees. Every 
          thing in the world has taught me something. The good things of the world 
          taught me what to see and how to be good and the bad things taught me 
          what I must avoid.&quot; The King saw the wisdom in the old man's words, 
          bowed to him and continued with his journey. </font></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000033"><b>The old man that the 
          king met was none other than the great saint Dattatreya. This is a story 
          that another great guru of modern times, Ramana Maharishi, narrated 
          frequently to his own followers to emphasize the importance of learning 
          and the role of Gurus.</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000033"><b>I want to share a personal 
          experience to further illustrate the concept that gurus appear in the 
          most unexpected of forms and learning takes place in the strangest of 
          circumstances. The guru in this case was none other than my dog Misha 
          - ar nine-year old German Shepherd. One day, late in the evening, I 
          returned home from work and drove the car into the garage. Misha came 
          running up to greet me as she does everyday. However on this day, I 
          noticed that Misha's food bowl was turned upside down (this is her way 
          of telling me she does not like her food). She had spilled her food 
          all over the garage floor, which was now being eaten by a swarm of ants. 
          Instead of petting Misha as I normally do, I was upset. After a long 
          day of work, now I must clean the garage. I shouted at Misha and scared, 
          Misha ran and hid behind the car. After a couple of minutes, I felt 
          bad about yelling at her when she didn't really even know what she had 
          done to make me upset. I called Misha's name more softly this time and 
          she came running towards me with her tail wagging and full of joy. All 
          was forgotten and forgiven. </b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000033"><b>At that moment, Misha 
          became my teacher. She taught me that forgiving people of their stupidity 
          is the best way to get them to realize their own shortcomings. Misha 
          taught me how not to carry a grudge or seek revenge. Rather, she showed 
          me what it was to be humble and loving. She made me realize my own ignorance 
          in being so impatient with her. That night I also learnt that if one 
          is willing to learn, a guru can be found in the most unpredictable places. 
          While the story of Misha illustrates that gurus may come in many forms, 
          it is important to recognize that relationship with a guru can enrich 
          our lives because of the knowledge that a guru can impart. </b></font></p>
        <font face="Times New Roman" color="#000033"><b>The English word, teacher 
        is not adequate to define a guru. It is important for us to note the distinction 
        between a guru and a teacher. Anyone with adequate training (e.g. in music 
        or painting) can be a teacher. A guru, on the contrary, goes beyond the 
        subject knowledge and becomes a mentor and a spiritual guide, leading 
        the shishya (disciple). To lead and to be led, both the guru and the shishya 
        need sincerity and a dedication to each other. Because you pay someone 
        $20 per hour to give you piano lessons for one hour does not make for 
        guru-shishya relationship. In a guru-shishya relationship, a disciple 
        (the word originated from discipline) dedicates himself to the guru because 
        of an inner desire to be led. The guru, in turn, takes the shishya as 
        a sesha (an integral person in his life) and considers the mentoring of 
        the shishya as his sacred duty. Only such mutual dedication and attachment 
        makes for a guru-shishya relationship. <br>
        </b></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000033"><b>The guru and shishya 
          relationship is unique to India and has been cultivated over 2,500 years 
          of Indian heritage. You will recollect that in the last issue when we 
          discussed the history of Hinduism, I referred to the Upanishad, the 
          philosophical texts. The word Upanishad comes from two words - upa and 
          nishad. Upa means sitting nearby and nishad means to listen and learn; 
          literally translated, Upanishad then refers to a dedicated shishya sitting 
          near a guru and listening and learning from the spiritual experiences 
          of a great master. In this relationship, the shisya considers the guru 
          to be God himself and has absolute faith in the teachings and guidance 
          of the guru. For his part, the guru dedicates himself to the guidance 
          of the shishya. There is no competition in this relationship - just 
          mutual respect. Nothing in this world is more satisfying to the guru 
          than the accomplishments of his shishya. Such is the greatness of this 
          relationship. However, for both the guru and the shishya, finding this 
          relationship is as much about chance as it is about ones own willingness 
          to find knowledge wherever it may reside. </b></font></p>
        <font face="Times New Roman" color="#000033"><b>The following story also 
        illustrates the importance of the guru-sishya relationship. Over three 
        centuries ago, in Southern India, a great musician by the name of Sonti 
        Venkatramaniah lived. Sonti Venkatramaniah taught music to several students 
        and he was also the principle musician of the King Sarbhoji's court. At 
        this time, the great composer Saint Thyagaraja was just six years old. 
        The young Thyagaraja walked by Venkatramaniah's home every day on the 
        way to the temple. Each time he passed by Venkatramaniah's home, Thyagaraja 
        would stop and listen to the music coming from inside the home. One day, 
        Venkatramaniah posed an intricate music question to his advanced music 
        students and none of them could answer the question. Thyagaraja who is 
        yet to have formal training in music, was standing outside and listening 
        and shouted the correct answer to the question. Guru Venkatramaniah was 
        so impressed by the young Thyagaraja's knowledge, that he immediately 
        took him as his disciple and started teaching him music. After a few years 
        of teaching, Guru Venkatramaniah took the still young Thyagaraja to the 
        King's court and asked him to sing in the august presence of several great 
        musicians. The great Thyagaraja, on the spot, composed the song, Doraguna 
        Etuvanti Seva (Raga: Bilahari). When translated, the song means: &quot;Can 
        anyone get this kind of a blessing? To sing in the presence of my guru 
        - even the Devas (the angels) are not so blessed as I (Thyagaraja).&quot; 
        In response, Guru Venkatramaniah exclaimed, Doraguna Iduvamdi Sishyudu 
        (Can anyone be more blessed than I to get a disciple such as Thyagaraja?). 
        This simple episode illustrates the dedication of a disciple to a guru 
        and the love and admiration of a guru to a disciple. <br>
        </b></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000033"><b>Learning anything requires 
          discipline and dedication. A guru is an integral part of that learning. 
          If you are sincere and dedicated about learning - whether it is the 
          arts or about life - you will find a guru. As I learned, sometimes gurus 
          can also transcend human form and appear as a furry creature that is 
          always happy to see me. Regardless of the form, if you are open to learning 
          , there is no limit to what can be learned. </b></font></p>
