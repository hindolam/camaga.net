        world is a diverse place. It contains people of all hues - white, black, 
        brown, and yellow, who trace their roots to many ethnic races -- African, 
        Caucasian and Oriental. We belong to many religions and differentiate 
        ourselves by various castes and creeds. We speak different languages, 
        eat different food, and wear different clothes. It is no wonder there 
        are so many problems when it comes to relating to one another across languages 
        and boundaries. Or is it possible that it is these differences that make 
        the world fun and interesting?</font></b></o:p> 
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>A perfect world 
          in our own imagination would be filled with people who have the same 
          beliefs, think like us, and act like us and maybe even look like us. 
          But no matter how fascinated we are with ourselves, I think it's safe 
          to admit that this would make for a very boring world. Imagine that 
          we meet a stranger and know immediately what he is thinking, how he 
          will react to what you say and not add anything new to the conversation. 
          It would be like reading a mystery novel and knowing who the culprit 
          is in the first chapter. It would be like being stuck in an episode 
          of the Twilight Zone for eternity. </b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Our differences 
          definitely provide variety and excitement to this world. People, through 
          their origins, religions and beliefs, have produced unique cultures 
          that shape each individual. We can view this process of culture development 
          somewhat like gardening. In order to grow a tree, first you till the 
          soil (basic nourishment), apply manure (rules and morals), plant the 
          seeds (education), water and nourish the trees and plants (learn from 
          the experience of others), prune the knots and remove the weeds regularly 
          (correct judgmental or ignorant attitudes and beliefs). It takes a long 
          time to make a beautiful garden just as it takes a long time for people 
          to learn how to interact with each other without fearing what they do 
          not understand. Once they have matured, the plants in the garden produce 
          beautiful flowers and the trees provide shade and edible fruits. Culture 
          is very similar. It is the product of millions of people over thousands 
          of years and reflects their thoughts, actions, and philosophies. Like 
          the plants and trees in a garden, culture contributes to the richness 
          of our landscape.</b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>It is a natural 
          instinct for humans to mistakenly believe that their culture is better 
          than that of others. They will point to actions and practices of other 
          cultures that, in their opinion, are inferior to their own culture. 
          We have often heard, for example, that people who eat with their hands 
          are less civilized than, say, people who eat with a fork and knife. 
          Silly, especially when you know how good food tastes when eaten from 
          your mother's hands. But we must not confuse culture with preference. 
          Culture is far more about peoples' beliefs and actions and far less 
          about what they eat, wear, or own. When we compare the basic goals and 
          beliefs of people, we will find that, the things we cherish the most 
          are generally the same.</b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Since many of 
          us are of Indian origin and live in North America, let us compare the 
          Indian and American cultures. Unlike the Indian culture, American culture 
          is predominantly European in origin. It seems different from Indian 
          culture because the demands are different; people eat different food, 
          the climate is different, and the traditions are different. An American 
          may express his thoughts differently or react differently to events. 
          But, underneath, these two cultures are very similar. Both Americans 
          and Indians want to be happy, believe in a superior God; seek an orderly 
          and stable society, and a close circle of parents, children, grandparents, 
          and community. These goals are no different in the Middle East or South 
          America or Africa. Once we recognize this fundamental similarity, we 
          will stop categorizing people by things as simple as color and start 
          understanding the complexity of each individual's experience on this 
          planet. As a result, culture becomes richer when we treat each other 
          with respect and compassion and recognize that our origins make us neither 
          superior nor inferior</b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>There is only 
          one universal truth: a person becomes enlightened only through the quality 
          of his/her actions and not merely by the status of their birth or monetary 
          wealth. The scriptures and literatures of the world religions are filled 
          with stories that illustrate this basic truth. In the eyes of God, every 
          creature is the same -- appearance, wealth, and even education makes 
          no difference to God. That's what makes God the infallible being that 
          it has become in every religion, across centuries and civilizations. 
          If and when we, as humans, ever attain the status of God, perhaps then, 
          we can claim to be superior. Maybe. </b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>The following 
          story from Indian literature illustrates this concept. Chidambaram is 
          a small town in Southern India. It's a town that is famous for housing 
          one of the five most well known Shiva temples. A Long time ago, a learned 
          scholar and jnani (a wise man) by the name of Sivacharya lived in Chidambaram. 
          He often went into deep meditation and stayed in a state of trance for 
          days. During this period, he did not follow the rituals that he was 
          expected to perform every day. The fellow priests and scholars were 
          outraged by his lack of discipline and excommunicated him from the village. 
          Sivacharya was banished from the village and forced to live in the forest. 
          In the forest, the only human contact he had was a low caste person 
          by the name of Pethan Samban. Samban brought Sivacharya his food and 
          helped him with his religious rituals. His little dog always followed 
          Samban when he visited Sivacharya's hut. One day, a saint appeared before 
          Sivacharya, gave him a verse written in a palm leaf, and left without 
          uttering a word. The wise Sivacharya immediately knew that the saint 
          was none other than Lord Shiva in disguise and that Shiva was asking 
          him to bless Samban for his devotion and sincerity. Accordingly, Sivacharya 
          read the verse out loud and blessed Samban. Samban immediately became 
          a holy person and vanished into a light. </b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>The priests from 
          the Chidambaram temple, who viewed Sivacharya as an enemy because of 
          his unorthodox practices, came to know of this event and filed a false 
          complaint with the king that Sivacharya had killed Samban. At the inquiry, 
          Sivacharya showed the king the note from Shiva and said that he was 
          merely following the command of the God to liberate Samban. The king 
          did not believe his story and asked him to prove that he could make 
          such a miracle happen. The king asked his servants to bring the little 
          dog that belonged to Samban and asked Sivacharya to liberate the dog. 
          Accordingly, Sivacharya read the verse and blessed the dog and the dog 
          also vanished into the light. Sivacharya then took the king and his 
          retinue to Shiva's temple and lit a lamp. On either side of Shiva appeared 
          Samban and the little dog. The king bowed before the wise Sivacharya 
          and apologized to him for disbelieving him.</b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>This story illustrates 
          that to Shiva, Samban's sincerity, dedication, and purity of thought 
          were more pleasing than his birth or wealth. The Samban story also illustrates 
          that the only way to really become a superior being is to become a wiser 
          being. The truly religious constantly strive to advance their thoughts 
          and behaviors. Growing up requires that we not be affected by petty 
          differences or discriminate against people. Maturity requires that we 
          show kindness, love, and compassion to one and all without expecting 
          anything in return. Enlightenment allows us to see god within everyone 
          and everything </b></font></p>
