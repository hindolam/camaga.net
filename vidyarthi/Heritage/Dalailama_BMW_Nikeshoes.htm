          <b><font face="Times New Roman"><o:p></o:p>If you were stripped of all 
          of your possessions, your status on the social ladder, and your resume 
          stating that you got a 1600 on your SAT's, would a stranger still think 
          of you as a good human being? I am addressing this question particularly 
          to the readers of this magazine, most </font></b><b><font face="Times New Roman"><o:p>of 
          whom I assume, were either born in North America or came here from India 
          at a young age. I also assume that, as a young person of Indian origin 
          growing up in a Western country, you often face conflicts between the 
          Indian values that you are required to follow at home and the Western 
          culture that you are exposed to at school and among friends. And perhaps 
          like my own children, you feel that your parents, who grew up in India, 
          do not understand the conflicts that you go through sandwiched between 
          two cultures that pull you in opposite directions. Balancing these conflicts 
          of living, in between two cultures is not easy for anyone. But people 
          who function successfully in either environment have a secret weapon 
          at their disposal; harmony within themselves. <br>
          <br>
          My wife and I have accepted that we did not understand the issues that 
          our children confronted when they were growing up. Although all kids 
          are faced with challenges, immigrant children face their own unique 
          obstacles. How well children manage these cultural conflicts depends 
          as much on their parents' flexibility as it does on the child's attitudes 
          about life. But like all obstacles in life, one must learn how to manage 
          these obstacles without letting them control who you are. To do so is 
          to attain harmony within you. </o:p></font></b></p>
        <p><b><font face="Times New Roman">First generation children of Indian 
          decent have high expectations to meet. Living up to expectations set 
          by most Indian parents requires that you study well in school, and excel 
          in academics. To function in western society you are expected to participate 
          in lots of extra curricular activities, go to prom, maintain your status 
          by buying expensive clothes, and learn how to relate to American kids 
          on their level. In addition to all this, you must also endure the scrutiny 
          of the community to which you belong. In short, you must maintain the 
          demeanor of a &quot;good&quot; Indian child while succeeding in your 
          role as a normal American. First generation Indian children face the 
          pressure to conform and to achieve on a daily basis and many Indian 
          children are confused by the multiple roles that they must juggle. While 
          this pressure can seem overwhelming at times, you must always ask yourself 
          one thing when in any situation; in spite of my accomplishments and 
          my popularity, am I being true to myself? </font></b></p>
        <p><b><font face="Times New Roman"><img src="images/Nikeshoes.jpg" width="100" height="52"> 
          Your experience as a human depends on how you deal with these pressures 
          </font></b><b><font face="Times New Roman">while remaining true to yourself. 
          Who you are ultimately depends on the person you are outside of how 
          many activities you participate in or how expensive your shoes are. 
          <img width="138" height="70" align="right" src="images/BMW.jpg"></font></b><b><font face="Times New Roman">Wearing 
          name brand clothes, being accepted by your friends, and gaining the 
          praise of your parents won't necessarily make you happy. To find true 
          happiness, you cannot rely on the image you project to family and peers. 
          Rather you must develop a sense of who you are outside of the roles 
          that you must conform to. By understanding what makes you happy, you 
          will be able to balance the expectations put on you with your desires 
          for yourself. As said by many great people throughout history, true 
          happiness lies within you. </font></b> </p>
        <p><b><font face="Times New Roman">As Dalai Lama, the Tibetan monk and 
          religious scholar, points out, unlike unhappy people, happy people are 
          not self-focused. They care more about others and less about their personal 
          needs or what others think of them. Even adverse conditions do not bother 
          them; they are happy in every condition. In the book, &quot;The Art 
          of Happiness&quot; Dalai Lama narrates two real-life events. In the 
          first instance, a survey of individuals who won millions of dollars 
          from the lottery were asked how happy they are now that they have so 
          much money and can buy any thing that they want. The response from the 
          lottery winners was that the initial happiness that came with the money 
          soon wore out and, like the rest of us; they were back to the usual 
          moment-to-moment happiness and unhappiness. In the second instance, 
          a young person found out that he was HIV positive. When asked about 
          this devastating condition, the young man replied that although he was 
          initially shocked, he now has a better take on life. He is happier than 
          he was in the past. Unlike in the past, when he was self-obsessed and 
          obsessed with material things, he now recognizes that he should live 
          his life to the fullest everyday. He no longer cared about making lots 
          of money and owning a fancy car and a big house. -. He started reading 
          a lot, meeting lots of people, discovering things around him that he 
          had never paid attention to in the past. He was happy to wake up in 
          the morning and to live every second of it to the fullest.</font></b></p>
        <p><b><font face="Times New Roman">I am not preaching that, as young people, 
          you should give up enjoying the material aspects of life or the status 
          that you have achieved with your friends. But you must recognize the 
          difference between what you have and who you are. The physical beauty 
          that comes from your clothes or appearance is fleeting. For the moment, 
          you may be the most popular kid in school. But soon, there will be someone 
          else on the scene with a newer car or wearing a trendier pair of shoes 
          and you are no longer the center of attention. But, life in not about 
          what you buy but about the quality of human being that you are, you 
          will be able to put your &quot;personal disappointments&quot; into perspective, 
          and will live a much happier and richer life. Old people always say 
          things to young people about how their priorities change when they get 
          older. But becoming an adult does not guarantee inner happiness. Perhaps 
          it is more appropriate to say that your priorities won't change unless 
          you understand who you are as a person outside of the things you own. 
          </font></b></p>
        <p><b><font face="Times New Roman">Now consider the following story from 
          Indian classical music. Thyagaraja, the famous poet and composer and 
          a great devotee of Lord Rama, was once summoned to the kingdom of Sarabhoji 
          Maharaja. The king offered Thyagaraja lots of jewelry and money and 
          then asked him to compose a song in praise of him. Although Thyagaraja 
          was very poor, he declined the money offered by the king and refused 
          to compose a song in praise of the king. He turned to the king and said, 
          &quot;What makes me happy in life is not the money and the jewelry but 
          my devotion to Lord Rama. I am not going to give up that happiness for 
          the sake of this wealth.&quot; Thyagaraja then composed the song &quot;Nidhi 
          Sala Sugama&quot; in the raga Kalyani. In the song, Thyagaraja states, 
          &quot;Would money and materials things give me the greatest happiness 
          or will doing service to Lord Rama give me the greatest happiness? Practicing 
          modesty and living peacefully is like bathing in the holy river Ganges 
          while looking for short-lived material pleasures is like bathing in 
          small mud-filled pond.</font></b></p>
        <p><b><font face="Times New Roman">In short, finding happiness requires 
          much more that making tons of money. It requires you to reflect on what 
          truly makes you happy, whether that's music, religion, spending time 
          with your friends or just being alive. Appreciate every moment you have 
          been given on earth as if it was your last and you will find wealth 
          that can never be measured: the wealth of love, happiness and the joy 
          of just being able to experience life. </font></b></p>
