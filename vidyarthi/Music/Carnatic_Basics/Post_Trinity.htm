<p align="center"><strong><font color="#660000" size="5">Post-Trinity</font></strong></p>
<p align="left">Carnatic music continued its glorious past even after the days 
  of the Trinity. During the last century and even today, several great composers 
  have continued to dominate the Carnatic scene. The current period is distinguished 
  also by the variety of languages and emotions that are expressed in the songs. 
  While continuing the earlier tradition of bhakthi and deovition as the primary 
  goal, later day composers have also used their creativity to produce compositions 
  that excelled in technical and emotional attributes. For example, the thillanas, 
  padams, and kritis created by modern day composers such as G. N. Balasubramaniam, 
  M. Balamurali Krishna, Lalgudi Jeyaraman, and T. N. Seshgopalan are notable 
  for their musicology and lyrical content. Thus, we can be proud that over 1,000 
  years, Carnatic music composers have continued to maintain the rich tradition 
  of our music and culture and today's composers continue to preserve this greatness. 
  In the following table, I have provided a brief biography only for some of the 
  post-trinity composers who have since left this world. Although at the end of 
  this writeup, I have listed some of the great composers who are still amongst 
  us, I have not provided a biography of their lives. I will add to this site 
  in the future. </p>

<p><strong>Subbarama Dikshitar (1839-1906): </strong>He was the nephew of the 
  illustrious Muthusawamy Dikshitar and grandson of Baluswamy Dikshitar, brother 
  of Muthuswamy Dikshitar. Subbrama Dikshitar was a learned Sanskrit scholar and 
  he was also very proficient in playing the Veena and the theory of Carnatic 
  music. </p>
<p>Subbarama Dikshitar had composed many varnams and other compositions. He is 
  most well known for writing the theory of music and the book, Sangeeta Sampradaya 
  Pradarsini. In this book, he has included his compositions and has also elaborated 
  on Venkatamukhi's melakarta scheme. The book is widely used by musicologists 
  and other scholars as a reference manual. Most of his compositions were in the 
  Telugu language. </p>
<p><strong>Wallajapet Venkatramana Bhagavathar (18/19th Centuries): </strong>Like 
  many of his great predecessors, Venkatramana Bhagavathar was also born in Thanjavur 
  district. Like the mythical Ekalavya, Venkatramana Bhagavathar, for a long time, 
  could learn music from Sri Thyagaraja Swami only from a distance; by observing 
  him teach his disciples. He used to take Thulasi for Sri Thyagaraja Swami's 
  pooja routine and admiring his sense of devotion and bhakthi, Sri Thyagaraja 
  Swami began to teach music to Venkatramana Bhagavathar. Venkatramana Bhagavathar 
  later settled down in Wallajapet, nearer to Madras and thus established the 
  Wallajapet school traiditon of Sri Thyagaraja Swami's disciples.</p>
<p>Several of his compositions were dedicated to the memory of his guru. Some 
  of his compositions include: Gurucharanam Bhajare in Sankarabharanam; Kanulara 
  Kantini (Dhanyasi), Sri Rama Brahma (Begadai) and Sri Narasimha in Kanada.</p>
<p><strong>Pallavi Seshayyar (1842-1905)</strong>: Pallvai Seshayyar is the son 
  of Neyakkarpatti Subbayar, a disciple of Saint Thyagaraja. Pallavi Seshayyar 
  loearnt music from his father. He had composed several kritis, Pada-Varnams 
  and Thillanas and has used rare ragas such as Mallikavasanta and Suddha. He 
  was also a gifted singer and his ability to render complicated Pallavais earned 
  him the title Pallavi Seshayyar. He was an ardent devotee of Lord Rama and all 
  his compositions were in praise of Sri rama. </p>
<p><strong>Maha Vaidyanatha Iyer</strong>: He was also born Thanjavur Distirct. 
  He had his initial training under Anai - Ayya brothers and then from the great 
  musician, Manambuchavadi Venkatasubbayyar, himself a disciple of Saint Thyagaraja.<br>
  Region: He was born in Vaiyacheri, near Tanjavur, Tamilnadu. Importance of Vaidyanatha 
  Iyer is evidenced by none other than the fact that, at the age of twelve, he 
  was awarded the title of Maha or Great. He was an accomplished musician as well 
  as a composer. Vaidyanatha Iyer was well known for his manodharma or creativity 
  and for his ability to perform complicated Ragam, Thanam, and Pallavi. The legend 
  goes that he sang in the Gandhara sruthi and used to move with ease between 
  various temps with absolutel control. </p>
<p>He was most known for composing varnams and thillanas. One of his thillana 
  is in Simhanandana tala (the most complicated among the thalas). Simlarly, he 
  has composed a ragamalika that included all of the 72-melakarta ragas. A noteworthy 
  feature of this ragamalika is that it also describes the raga characteristics 
  of each of the raga used in them. Maha Vaidyanatha Sivan (1844-1893): In his 
  book 'Isaiyulagil Maha Vaidyanatha Sivan', Vidwan Veena Subbaiah Bhagavatar 
  says Maha really did not undergo Gurukula Vasam under Venkatasubbayyar. His 
  father Duraiswamy Iyer was a friend of Venkatasubbayyar and whenever the former 
  visited Tanjore, he would stay with Venkatasubbayyar. He would also take his 
  young son with him and while there, Venkatasubbayyar would teach the bright 
  child. You can identify his compositions from the mudra or signature when it 
  says Guhadasa. Many of us are also familiar with his kriti, Pahimam Srirajarajeswari 
  (Janaranjani), Neekela dayaradu (Sarasangi), and Sri Sankara (Nagaswaravali)..<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Patnam Subramania Iyer (1845-1902):</strong> He was known as the Chinna 
  or the mini-version of Saint Thyagaraja Swami. Like his contemporary, Sri Maha 
  Vaidyanatha Iyer, he also learns music from the famous Manambuchavadi Venkatasubbayyar, 
  a disciple of Thyagaraja. </p>
<p>Patnam Subramania Iyer has composed over one hundred songs that include varnams, 
  padams, javalis, thillanas and the traditional kritis. Many of these songs are 
  used in concerts even today. For example, the Varnam Evaribodhana in Abhogi 
  is a very well-known Varnam and so is the Kriti, Raghuvamsa Sudha in Kadanakutoohalam. 
  Though he mostly composed in the Telugu language, he also used Tamil and Sanskrit 
  languages occasionally to compose. <br>
</p>
<p><strong>Thiruvottiyur Thyaggaya (1845 - 1917)</strong>: He was born in Thiruvottiyur, 
  near Madras city. Thyaggaya hailed from a family of musicians and was the son 
  of another famour composer, Veena Kuppayyar. He composed many Varnams and Kritis 
  and most of them were in his native Telugu language. Some of the popular kritis 
  of Thiruvottiyur Thyaggaya include: Chalamela (Darbar), Ela na pai inta in Simharava, 
  Inta parakelara in Nattakurinji, and Samidayajuda in Kedaragaulam.</p>
<p><strong>Ramnad &quot;Poochi&quot; Srinivasa Iyengar (1860 - 1919)</strong> 
  was born in Ramanathapuram in Ramnad District of Tamilnadu. He learnt music 
  from another illustrious composer, Sri Patnam Subramanya Iyer. Poochi Srinivasa 
  Iyengar has composed many kritis, javalais, thillanas and varnams. He has mostly 
  used Telugu as the language medium to compose his songs. One of his illustrious 
  disciples is Koteeswara Iyer. </p>
<p><strong>Koteeswara Iyer ( 1870 - 1940):</strong> is the grandson of the illustrious 
  Kavikunjara Bharati, a contemporary of the Trinity and a composer of many great 
  compositions. Koteeswara Iyer learnt music from Ramanad &quot;Poochi&quot; Srinivasa 
  Iyengar and also, from Patnam Subramanya Iyer. Koteeswara Iyer had composed 
  songs in each one of the seventy two Melakarta ragams and many of his compositions 
  have been in praise of Lord Muruga. Two kritis are popular and well-known are: 
  Varanamukha (Hamsadhwani) and Arulseyyavendum (Rasikapriya). He ends his compositions 
  with his signature, Kavikunjaradasa.<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Swathi Thirunal Maharaja </strong>hails from the Kerala Royal family. 
  He was born in 1813 and was named Bala Rama Varma. However, because his birth 
  star was Swathi, he was popularly known as Swathi Thirunal. From his very young 
  age, Swathi Thirunal showed interests in the fine arts and in learning. As a 
  King, Swathi Thirunal invited great artists to his court (e.g. Harikesanallur 
  Muthia Bhagavathar) and encouraged the propagation of Indian fine arts including 
  Hindustani music, Bharathanatyam and Mohin Aattam. </p>
<p>Swathi Thirunal composed several songs including pada varnams, swarajathis, 
  and thillanas. Like many of his contemporaries and successors, Swathi Thirunal 
  Maharaja emphasized bhathi or devotion over romance or similar emotions in his 
  compositions. He used the signature Padmanabha, the presiding deity of the Trivandrum 
  temple in his compositions. Some of his well known compositions include: Bhavayami 
  Raghuramam (Ragamalika), Bhajabhajamaanasa (Sindhu Bhairavi), Chalamela (Sankarabharanam). 
  Devadeva Kalayami (Mayamalava Gaula), and Gopalakapahimam (Bhoopalam).<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Harikesanallur Muthiah Bhagavathar (1877 - 1945): </strong>He hailed 
  from Harikesanallur in Thirunelveli District of Tamilnadu. Although a vedic 
  scholar, he was more attracted by Carnatic music. His compositions include varnams, 
  ktitis, and thillanas. Apart from using rare ragas to express the emotions in 
  his song, Sri Muthiah Bhagavathar composed songs that were full of artistic 
  intricacies and thala complexity that was unparalleled. He wrote a dissertation 
  called Sangeetha Kalpadruma and was accordingly awarded a Ph.D. Sri T. N. Seshagopalan, 
  the famour musician popularizes Sri Muthia Bhagavathar music very well and even 
  conducts a Aradhana type day to celebrate his memory.</p>
<p> <strong>Maharaja Jayachamrajendra Wodeyar(1919 - 1974)</strong> was the Maharaja 
  of the Mysore Province or State. Like Royalty, He was trained not only in languages 
  but also in other fine arts. He underwent music training with many stalwarts 
  of the music field such as, Tiger Varadachariar, Mysore Vasudevachar, Muthaiah 
  Bhagavatar, Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar, and Gotuvadyam Narayana Iyengar. He 
  had composed many of songs and has used several rare ragas such as Duvangi. 
  Two of his well known compositions include: Srijalandhara (Gambheeranata) and 
  Mahaganapatim (Amritavahini).<br>
</p>
<p> <strong>Mysore Vasdevachar (1885):</strong> Although a native of Karnataka, 
  he learns music from the illustrious composer Patnam Subramania Iyer, who was 
  then living in Thiruvayyar in Tanjore Distirct. Vasudevachar had composed over 
  two hundred songs and since he was very proficient in Hindustani music as well, 
  he used both Carnatic and Hindustani ragas to compose his songs. He is also 
  very proficient in the thala aspects and has used each of the thalas from the 
  Sulapdi Sapta tala scheme in his various compositions. Some of his popular compositions 
  include: Brochevarevarura (Khamas) and Bhajare re Manasa (Bhimplas).<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Papanasam Sivan (1890-1973)</strong> lived amongt us until recently 
  and some of us are blessed in having seen him in person during Music Academy 
  functions. He is called the modern day Thyagaraja and could be aptly described 
  as the greatest composer of the Post-Trinity period. </p>
<p> He lived in Chennai and composed mainly in the Tamil language. His songs contained 
  beautiful lyrics and for people proficient in the Tamil language, it was a great 
  and fulfilling experience to listen to his lyrics. To those of us who had lived 
  in Madras and have visited the Kapaleeswarar temple in Mylapore many times, 
  Sri Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s kritis bring vivid images of the Lord of the temple 
  and its surrounding deities. Some of his most popular compositions include Kapali 
  (Mohanam), Nanoru Vilayattu Bommaiya (Navarasa Kannada) Idathu Padham Thooki 
  (Kamas). Kaana Kann Kodi (Kamboji), and Thaye Ezhaipal Dhayavu (Bharivai). </p>
<p> Papanasam Sivan has also written many songs for Tamil movies. In the early 
  days of Tamil cinema, the compositions were almost always set to Carnatic music 
  ragas and Papanasam Sivan elevated the music to further heights by his lyrics. 
  Today, his grandson and a musican by profession, Sri Ashok Ramani has taken 
  it upon himself to preserve Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s compositions and his legacy.
