font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>He converted dissonance into music</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>REFLECTIONS: N. Kotiswara Aiyar had the
rare distinction of composing songs in Tamil in all the 72 ragas.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>V. Sriram October 30, 2009</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The death of N. Kotiswara Aiyar was
announced in The Hindu dated October 21 (... 1938) and the headline read
&#8216;Death of a prominent musician.&#8217; In keeping with the manner of
reporting in those days, the news item gave details of his passing. &#8220;Till
last Thursday he was all right and that afternoon, had a sudden attack of
something like paralysis of the throat muscles which prevented him from taking
any food. Last Saturday, he was admitted into the General Hospital. He passed
away at 10.50 a.m. this morning.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>This was followed by a detailed obituary
by E. Krishna Aiyar, written in his capacity as secretary, The Music Academy.
EK wrote &#8216;amidst us we have very few composers of the real creative type.
A Papanasam Sivan here and a Muthiah Bhagavatar there are some of the
exceptions of the rule. Vidwan Kotiswara Aiyar was one such exception.&#8221;
The article later traced Kotiswara Aiyar&#8217;s illustrious lineage, for he
was the grandson of Kavi Kunjara Bharati, the well-known poet who composed
songs compiled as Perinba Keertanas and Skanda Purana Keertanas. EK wrote that
Kotiswara Aiyar learnt music from Ramanathapuram Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar.
Other sources have had it that he also learnt music from Poochi Iyengar&#8217;s
guru Patnam Subramani Iyer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Academic pursuits</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>According to EK, Kotiswara Iyer
&#8216;took his BA degree after undergoing his college course in Pudukottah and
Trichinopoly.&#8217; On graduation, he was employed at the Inspector General of
Police office in Madras and later as a translator at the Madras High Court. In
between, he also served as an English teacher in the Venkataramana Ayurveda
Dispensary and Sanskrit College. It was only later in life that Kotiswara
Aiyar&#8217;s talents as a composer flowered. It was also owing to the
influence of what were then burning topics in the field of music.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The first concerned the vivadi or
dissonant scales, of which there are 40 in number in the Melakarta system.
While Tyagaraja had handled a few in his songs and Muthuswami Dikshitar had
handled almost all of them as per the raganga raga scheme (which unlike the
Melakarta scheme did not have straight scales for all the 72 mother ragas), it
was the considered view of many that the vivadis were not musical.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Madurai Ponnuswami Pillai, the eminent
nagswaram vidwan, even penned a treatise titled &#8216;Poorvika Sangita
Unmai&#8217; which denied the existence of the 40. It was also considered
inauspicious to sing vivadi ragas. This was also the time when the absence of
Tamil songs was being felt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>A mighty task</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Kotiswara Aiyar decided to compose songs
in all 72 melakartas, vivadi or not. In the words of Professor Sambamurthy,
&#8220;the composer took upon himself a mighty task and achieved the ideal. To
attempt pieces in unfamiliar ragas is a difficult task. He has to think out the
new ragas, form a picture in his mind and determine its jeeva, nyasa swaras and
raga ranjaka prayogas to put in his compositions. The music world will realise
the amount of time and thought this illustrious composer must have bestowed in
these kritis.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Beginning with &#8216;Ma Madhura
Sarasa&#8217; in the raga Ganamurthy, Kotiswara Aiyar went on to compose songs
in all the 72 ragas, all of them in Tamil. The compilation of the shuddha
madhyama raga songs was brought out as the Kandaganamudam in 1932. In its
preface, the composer expressed the desire that just like Telugu, Tamil should
be given importance in concerts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The work received praise from Dwaram
Venkataswami Naidu, Kirtanacharya C.R. Srinivasa Iyengar, U. Ve. Swaminatha
Iyer, T.S. Sabesa Iyer, Harikesanallur Muthiah Bhagavatar, Tiger Varadachariar
and Papanasam Sivan. T.L. Venkatarama Iyer, reviewing it for The Hindu (October
12, 1932) noted that Kotiswara Aiyar &#8216;had made the first comprehensive
attempt to compose kirtanas in all melas. The scientific value of his kirtanas
is of a high order and this publication is a landmark.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The second volume, comprising the prati
madhyama ragas, was brought out in February 1938. On this occasion, an
overwhelmed Parur Sundaram Iyer wrote that his eyes had been opened to the
possibilities in the vivadi ragas. He praised Kotiswara Aiyar for making a bold
attempt to compose in these ragas with the vivadi or dissonant notes used in
full. This was a marked departure from earlier composers who minimised the
vivadi effect while using these ragas.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>It was as though Kotiswara Aiyar&#8217;s
task on earth was done for he passed away the same year. On October 25, 1938,
two lawyers N. Ramakrishnan and K. Rajagopalan in their tribute to Kotiswara
Aiyar in The Hindu, wrote that &#8216;it behoves all lovers of our music to
confer and devise means to perpetuate the memory of this great star
composer.&#8217; That came to reality when artists such as S. Rajam made it
their life&#8217;s mission.</span></p>
