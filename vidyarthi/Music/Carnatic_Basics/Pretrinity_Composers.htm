<p>I have provided a list of names of some of the greatest composers from the 
  pre-trinity (before the late eighteenth century). I have <span class=SpellE>briefely</span> 
  discussed only some of these composers and I will continue to add to this list 
  in the future.</p>

<p><span class=SpellE><strong>Thirunavukkarasar</strong></span><strong>: (7th 
  Century) </strong>This great composer was also known by the name of <span class=SpellE>Appar</span>. 
  He hailed from <span class=SpellE>Thanjavur</span> in <span class=SpellE>Tamilnadu</span>. 
  He was a <span class=SpellE>Saivite</span> or a devotee of Shiva and was known 
  as one of the three great saints of the <span class=SpellE>Tevaram</span> Trinity. 
  <span class=SpellE>Tevara</span> <span class=SpellE>Pathigams</span> are sacred 
  <span class=SpellE>humns</span> and <span class=SpellE>Thirunavvukkarasar</span> 
  has composed over 30,000 verses of the <span class=SpellE>Thevaram</span>. Even 
  today, in <span class=SpellE>Saivite</span> temples, <span class=SpellE>Thevaram</span> 
  is recited as part of the <span class=SpellE>rituaals</span>. <span
class=SpellE>Thevaram</span> songs belong to the musical form &quot;<span
class=SpellE>Virutham</span>.&quot; <span class=SpellE><strong>Appar</strong></span><strong> 
  </strong>is known as the father of the <span class=SpellE>bhakthi</span> or 
  devotional movement. The <span class=SpellE>Thevaram</span> <span class=SpellE>humns</span> 
  convey great philosophical ideas and are written in simple language so that 
  the common individual can relate to them and <span class=SpellE>udnerstand</span> 
  their significance<span class=GramE>..</span> The <span class=SpellE>Thevarams</span> 
  are grouped under the song classification &quot;<span class=SpellE>Thirumurai</span>.&quot; 
</p>
<p><span class=SpellE><strong>Thirugnana Sambandar</strong></span><strong>:</strong> 
  <strong>(7th Century)</strong> Like his predecessor, <span class=SpellE>Appar</span>, 
  <span class=SpellE>Sambandar</span>, was born in the <span class=SpellE>Thanjavoor</span> 
  district. He is supposed to have been blessed by Goddess <span class=SpellE>Parvathi</span> 
  and from then on began to compose songs and other devotional lyrics. His songs 
  are classified as <span class=SpellE>virutham</span>. The story is that <span
class=SpellE>Sambandar</span> composed his first song, <span class=SpellE>tOdudaiya</span> 
  <span class=SpellE>Seviyan</span>, at the age of three, making him the youngest 
  composer ever in the world. <span class=SpellE>Sambandar</span> wrote a variety 
  of compositions, some about nature; others, as a combination of romance and 
  <span
class=SpellE>bhakthi</span> or devotion, visioning Shiva as the <span
class=SpellE>Nayakan</span> and the poet as the <span class=SpellE>Nayaki</span>. 
  Thus, <span class=SpellE>Sambandar</span> contributed to the development of 
  not only <span class=SpellE>Saivism</span> but also to the development of music.</p>
<p><span class=SpellE><strong>Sundarar</strong></span>: <strong>(7th Century)</strong> 
  followed both <span
class=SpellE>Appar</span> and <span class=SpellE>Sambandar</span> and has even 
  composed songs about these two great poets who preceded him. His songs, somewhat 
  like <span class=SpellE>Sambandar&#8217;s</span> hymns, portray Lord Shiva as 
  his friend, philosopher and even the playmate with whom he sometimes talks to 
  in anger, jest, and affection.</p>
<p><span class=SpellE><strong>Azhvars</strong></span> <strong>(6th to 11th centuries<span
class=GramE>)</span></strong><br>
  Unlike the three great <span class=SpellE>Saivite</span> composers &#8211; <span
class=SpellE>Appar</span>, <span class=SpellE>Sambandar</span>, and <span
class=SpellE>Sundarar</span> &#8211; the <span class=SpellE>Azhvars</span> sang 
  in praise of Vishnu. There were 12 <span class=SpellE>Azhvars</span>. <span
class=SpellE>Nathamuni</span>, an admirer of <span class=SpellE>Mathura</span> 
  <span
class=SpellE>Kavi</span> <span class=SpellE>Azhvar</span>, a disciple of <span
class=SpellE>Nammazhvar</span>, compiled 4,000 hymns composed by the <span
class=SpellE>Azhvars</span> into a book called the &#8220;<span class=SpellE>Nalayira</span> 
  <span class=SpellE>Divya</span> <span class=SpellE>Prabhandam</span>,&#8221; 
  a book considered sacred and important for expressing <span class=SpellE>bhakthi</span> 
  by the <span class=SpellE>Vaishnavite</span> followers. A great feature of the 
  <span
class=SpellE>Azhvar&#8217;s</span> compositions is that they emphasize that, in 
  reality, there is no difference between Shiva and Vishnu, bringing out the unity 
  of one <span class=SpellE>Paramapursha</span>. Andal, was the only female Azhvar. 
  She is supposed to have composed the Thiruppavai, devotional hymns sung during 
  the month of Margazhi (Dec-Jan).</p>
<p><span class=SpellE><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Manickavachagar (10th 
  Century)</b></span><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>:</b> Another great composer of the 10th century 
  was <span class=SpellE>Manickavasagar</span>. He is the composer of two of the 
  greatest poetical treatise of his period, <span class=SpellE>ThiruvAchakam</span> 
  and <span class=SpellE>TiruvempAvai</span>. Although I have mentioned the period 
  as tenth century, it is not absolutely certain whether he was from this period. 
  <span class=GramE>A few historians date <span class=SpellE>Manickavasagar</span> 
  as pre-<span class=SpellE>Thevaram</span> period (before the 7th century) while 
  others place him as a poet from the post-<span class=SpellE>Thevaram</span> 
  (10th century or later) period.</span> Regardless of the period, the contributions 
  to Indian music and poetry that <span class=SpellE>Manickavasagar</span> made 
  through <span class=SpellE>ThiruvAchakam</span> and <span class=SpellE>TiruvempAvai</span> 
  is unquestionable.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <span class=SpellE>Thirunavukarasar</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Appar</span>, <span class=SpellE>Sambandar</span>, and <span
class=SpellE>Sundarar</span>, the <span class=SpellE>thirumurthi's</span> of <span
class=SpellE>Devaram</span> used several <span class=SpellE>PaNNs</span> or the 
  equivalent of modern day Raga and similarly, the <span class=SpellE>NalAiyira</span> 
  <span class=SpellE>Divyaprabhandam</span> also used several <span class=SpellE>PaNNs</span>. 
  Thus, the <span class=SpellE>Thevaram</span> <span class=SpellE>Thirumurthis</span> 
  and the twelve <span class=SpellE>Azhvars</span> have had a significant influence 
  on the subsequent development of Indian music system. Interested readers may 
  refer to <span class=SpellE>sangIta</span> <span class=SpellE>ratnAkara</span>, 
  the musical treatise written by <span class=SpellE>sAarangadeVa</span> points 
  to many <span class=SpellE>paNNs</span> as part of his treatise on Indian music.</p>
<p><strong>Jayadeva</strong> <strong>(12th Century)</strong> is the author of 
  Ashtapathi. Ashta means eight and these songs are written with eight charanams 
  and hence called Ashtapathis. Jayadeva also is well known for composing a musical 
  play (Gaya Natakam) in Sanskrit, called Geetha Govindam and Ashtapathis are 
  integral to each other. Jayadeva was a poet in the court of Lakshmana Sena of 
  Bengal. When Jayadeva wrote the Geetha Govindam, there was only one Indian music 
  and there were no separate distinctions called Carnatic music and Hindustani 
  music. In the Geetha Govindam, Jayadeva describes the relationship between Krishna 
  and Radha, his devotee, and symbolizes the union of the individual soul with 
  the universal soul or Paramathma and Jeevathma. </p>
<p><span class=SpellE><strong>Arunagirinathar</strong></span><strong> (15th Century)</strong>. 
  <span class=SpellE>Arunagirinathar</span> is the author of the famous Tamil 
  songs collectively called <span class=SpellE>Thiruppugazh</span> or the Praise 
  of the Lord. Most of the songs are in praise of Lord <span class=SpellE>Muruga</span>, 
  son of Shiva. Like <span class=SpellE>Appar</span>, <span class=SpellE>Sambandar</span>, 
  and <span class=SpellE>Sundarar</span>, <span class=SpellE>Arunagirinathar</span> 
  also set his songs to music. One of the greatest contributions of <span
class=SpellE>Arunagirinathar</span> is to the concept of <span class=SpellE>Laya</span> 
  or <span class=SpellE>Thalam</span>. Because of his contributions to the development 
  of <span class=SpellE>Thala</span>, <span class=SpellE>Arunagirinathar</span> 
  is given the title of &#8220;<span class=SpellE>Chandppavalapperuman</span>&#8221; 
  and &#8220;<span class=SpellE>Talachelvar</span>.&#8221; He has also been responsible 
  for highlighting some of the greatest ragas and setting his compositions in 
  such ragas as <span class=SpellE>Anandhabhairavi</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Varali</span>, <span class=SpellE>Lalitha</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Malahari</span>, <span class=SpellE>Bauli</span>, etc. Like the <span
class=SpellE>Azhvars</span>, <span class=SpellE>Arunagirinathar</span> did not 
  discriminate between <span class=SpellE>Saivism</span> and <span class=SpellE>Vaishnavism</span>. 
  To him, all of these <span class=GramE>philosophies,</span> took us to the same 
  destination and the unity of religions was more important than differences. 
  The <span class=SpellE>Thiruppugazh</span> highlight human values and righteous 
  conduct more than rituals or worship routines. Some of the notable works of 
  Arunagirinathar include: Kandarnubhoothi and Kandaralankaram &#8211; both in 
  praise of Lord Muruga or Karthikeya.</p>
<p><strong>Muththandavar (14th Century) </strong> Like many others before and 
  after him, Muthuthandavar became a poet because of his extreme devotion to God. 
  The story about Muthuthandavar is that when he was very young, he was affected 
  by a serious disease and was neglected by his relatives. He lived near the temple 
  and ate whatever was offered as food at the temple to devotees. He became very 
  frutstrated with his life and prayed to God to rescue him. Goddess Parvathi, 
  the wife of Lord Shiva appeared before him and asked him to go to the shirine 
  of Lord Nataraja in Chidambaram. Muthuthandavar does accordingly and begins 
  to compose songs in praise of Lord Shiva or Nataraja. His first composition 
  was &quot;Bhooloka kailasagiri chidambaram.&quot; His other famous song is &quot;Aru 
  marundoru thani marundu ambalaththe kandene&quot;. Muththandavar is well-known 
  for the padams and is credited with creating the padam form of Carnatic music.

<p><strong>Annamacharya</strong>: <strong>(15th Century) </strong>Annamacharya 
  or Tallpakam Annamacharya is from the holy city of Tirupathi, from the current 
  day Andhra Pradesh. Annmacharya was not only a great composer but also a musicologist. 
  He created the musical forms that we use today to separate a composition into 
  Pallavi, Anupallavi, and Charanam. Annamacharya was born as into family that 
  followed the Advaitic philosophy propounded by Adi Sankara. However, Annamacharya 
  was facinated by the Vaishnavite Azhvars and their compositions and accordingly, 
  converted to the Vishistadvaitic philosophy propounded by Sri Ramanuja. Some 
  scholars even to go the extent of saying that many of the compositions of Annamacharya 
  were literal translations of Azhvar pasurams into Telugu, his mother tongue. 
  Regardless of whether such claims are true or not, the greatest contribution 
  of Annamacharya is the codification of the bhajana or worship through songs 
  tradition. He promoted madhura bhakthi or a devotional worship where the devotee 
  assumes himself or herself to be a sweet heart of the Lord and consider the 
  Lord as the beloved Hero. </p>
<p>Some of the great works of Annmacharya include: Over 10,000 Sankirtanas or 
  musical lyrics, 12 Satakas (sets of one hundred verses), a treatise on SankIrtana 
  lakshaNa or the grammar of sankirtanas, Sringara Manjari, and Venkatachala Mahatmyam 
  in praise of Lord Venkateshwara of Tirupathi. </p>
<p><strong>Kshetrajna or Kshetrayya (16/17th Century): </strong>He was born in 
  Muvapuri in Krishna District of Andhra Pradesh. Many consider Kshetrajna to 
  be the father of Padams (same claims have been made of Muthuthandavar as well). 
  Like Annamacharya, Kshetrajna also promoted madhura bhakthi. He composed many 
  of his padams on rare ragas. Please refer to the article on music forms for 
  an explanation of Padams. He is supposed to have composed 4,200 padams of which 
  only about 125 are available today. Five of these padams were composed in praise 
  of King Vijayaraghava Naik of Thanjavur and are known as &quot;Vijayaraghava 
  Pancharathnam&quot; or &quot;Kshetrayya Pancharathnams.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Narayana Teertha (16th or 17th Century)</strong> took up sanyasa or 
  gave up family life at a very early age. His most famous contribution is the 
  &quot;Sri Krishna Leela Tharangini,&quot; a dance-drama in praise of Lord Krishna. 
  It was written in Sanksrit and consisted of twelve tarangas. The Krishna Leela 
  Tharangini is nothing but the essence of Bhagavad Gita composed into songs. 
  One of the well-known disciples of Narayana Thirtha is Sonti Venkatasubbaya, 
  himself the guru of the Great Saint Thyagaraja. Narayana Theertha was not only 
  a scholar of Carnatic music but also of Bharatha Natyam. The Sri Krishna Leela 
  Tharangini contains 12 tharangams (or waves), 147 Keerthanas, 267 Slokams, and 
  39 Gadyams (a musical form). The Krishna Leela Tharangini is also an opera and 
  takes us, through dance-drama, through the lives of Lord Krishna since his birth 
  throuogh his marriage with Rukmini. The ragas that Narayana Theertha selected 
  and used brings out the emotions. He is also supposed to have composed two other 
  operas, &quot;Parijatha Abaharanam&quot; and &quot;Haribhakthi Sundarnavam.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Bhadrachala Ramadasa (17th Century):</strong> Ramadas lived in Andhra 
  Pradesh. Bhadrachala Ramadas's famous work is the Dasrathi Satakam. Ramadasa 
  is supposed to have received his musical knowledge and blessing from the illustrious 
  Kabir Das. There is a famous story about Ramadasa Ramadasa was a clerk in the 
  Nawab's court. When Ramadas collected taxes from the citizens, instead of paying 
  it into the treasury, he used them to renovate the Sri Rama temple in Bhadrachalam. 
  The Nawab assumed that Ramadas has stolen the revenue for himself and accordingly, 
  put him in prison. Ramadas spent his time at the prison composing songs on Sri 
  Rama. One day, Lord Rama along with his brother Sri Lakshmana appeared like 
  ordinary citizens and paid the Nawab the money that Ramadas has spent building 
  the temple and got Ramadas released from the prison. Saint Thyagaraja also refers 
  to this incidence in his famous compostion, &quot;Ksheerasagarasayana.&quot; 
  . </p>
<p>Sarangapani (17th Century): Like Muthuthandavar before him, Poet Sarangapani 
  was famous for his padams.He has written over two hundred padams. He wrote compositions 
  in both Sanskrit and Telugu. In his personal life, he was a Minister of Education 
  in the court of Maharaja Venkata Perumal of Karvetinagaram, Andhra Pradesh. 
  Sarangapaniwas also a learned scholar of the Natya Sastra or the Art of Dance. 
  Most of his padams were in praise of Lord Krishna. </p>
<p> <strong>Purndaradasa (15/16 centuries)</strong>: Purandaradasa was born in 
  Pandharpur (currently in Karnataka State) and like his father, Purandaradasa 
  was a money-lender by profession. The story is that Purandaradasa was also very 
  miserly and he became liberated and became wise after Lord Vishnu came as a 
  Brahmin person, asking for alms for his son&#8217;s upanayanam and Purandaradasa&#8217;s 
  wife made Purandaradasa realize the greatness of sharing and charity.</p>
<p>After this incident, Purandaradas moved to Hampi and became a disciple of Vyasa 
  Raya and composed many songs in both Kannada and Sanksrit. His compositions 
  are simple and yet contain great meaning and wisdom. He composed his songs in 
  many rare ragas such as Vasanthabhairavi, Manjeesabhairavi, Maravi, etc. </p>
Purandaradasa is said to have codified or systematized the teaching of music and 
it is his contributions that allows every student to go through the hierarchical 
process of learning music starting from Sarali Varisai, Janta Varisai, Thattu 
Varisai, etc. For this reason, Purandaradasa is called the Pitha Maha of Carnatic 
music or the Great Father of Carnatic Music. Purandaradasa&#8217;s greatness was 
recognized even by his guru, Vyasa Raya. Vyasa Raya conferred the title Purandara 
Vittala on his disciple. <br>
<p> <strong>Arunachala Kavirayar </strong>lived in the 18th century. He was a 
  maste of the Kamba Ramayanam, written by the famous Tamil poet Kambar. Based 
  on the Ramayana Arunachala Kavirayar composed the &quot;Rama Nataka Keerthanaigal&quot; 
  Another famous compostion of Arunachala Kavirayar is the &quot;En palli kondeerayya,&quot; 
  in praise of Lord Ranganatha of Srirangam temple. He is also credited with other 
  literary works such as &quot;Ajamukhi natakam&quot;, &quot;Anumar Pillai Tamizh&quot;, 
  Sirkazhi Sthala Puranam&quot; and &quot;Sirkazhi kovai&quot;. </p>
<p><strong>Pachimiriyam Adiyappa</strong> lived in the 18th century. He is the 
  guru of the great Syama Sastry, one of the trinitis of Carnatic music. Many 
  of are familiar with the Viriboni varnam in Bhairavi ragam. Pachimiriyam Adiyappa 
  is the composer of this varnam. Sri Adiyappa is also well-known for contributing 
  the musical form tana varna. For this reason, he is known as the &quot;Tanavarna 
  margadarsi.&quot; </p>
<p><strong>Marimutha Pillai a</strong>lso lived during the 18th century. He is 
  supposed have composed songs from an early age and most of his compositions 
  were on Lord Nataraja of Chidambaram. His most famous contribution is the &quot;Puliyoor 
  Venpa.&quot; His compositions followed the Nindatuti format. </p>
<p><strong>Sadasiva Brahmendra</strong> was also a poet of the 17th century. Like 
  Narayana Thirtha, he took up sanyasa at a very young age. He had composed about 
  two dozen songs in the Sanksrit language. Most of them are sung as part of the 
  Bhajana sampradaya. Many of today's musicians have also popularized his compostions 
  (e.g. M. Balamuralikrishna). Most of his compositions were either about Sri 
  Rama or Lord Krishna and in some cases about the Nirguna Brahman or Lord without 
  attributes. One of his famous conposition is Gayathri Vanamali. </p>
<p><strong>Oothukadu <span class=SpellE>vEnkatasubbayyar</span></strong> was almost 
  the end of the gredat composers of the pre-triniti era. He hailed from Mannargudi 
  in Thanjavur District of current day Tamilnadu. He is also popularly known as 
  Venkata Kavi. Venkata Kavi is supposed to have been blessed by Lord Krishna 
  and hence acquired his musical knowledge through the Lord's blessings. Most 
  of Venkatasubbayar's compositions have not been preserved and have been lost 
  to posterity. If we preserve even some of his compositions today and have access 
  to the treasures of this great musician, it is because of musicians such as 
  Needamangalam Krishnamurthy Bhagavatar and most recently, Chitraveena Ravikiran. 
</p>
<p>Oothukkadu Venkata Kavi was prolific and was a learned scholar of not only 
  music but also dance and was proficient in many languages. His knowledge translated 
  itself into his compositions evidenced by the hundreds of rare and traditional 
  ragas that he has used and the rare and complicated thalas that he has handled. 
  He not only produced the regular kritis but also various forms within them such 
  as tillana, sloka, kavadi chindu, and javali. His most significant contributions 
  include: Kamakshi Navavarna kritis, Saptaratnas (similar to Pancharathnas of 
  Saint Thyagaraja), and even couple of operas. His compositions expressed not 
  only bhakthi and devoition to God but also moral values such as humility and 
  modesty. </p>
