    or structures can be classified into two basic formats: Abhyasa Ganam or those 
    useful for the purposes of learning and practicing music and Sabha Ganam, 
    those useful for the purposes of performing such as, in a concert or public 
    gathering. Those of us who have learnt to sing or play instruments such as 
    violin, flute, or similar instruments would have gone through the rituals 
    or various steps during the process of such learning. For example, early music 
    lessions begin with Sarali Varisai (S R G M P D N) , Jantai Varisai (SS RR 
    GG MM PP DD NN SS), Thara Sthayi and thakku sthayi varisais, Thattu Varisai, 
    Alankaram, Geetham, Swarajathi, Jatiswaram, and Varnam. Similarly, at the 
    next higher stage, we begin learning Varnams, Kritis, Padam, Javali, Thillana, 
    RTP, Ragamalika etc. These are Sabha Ganam. We will discuss some of these 
    musical forms in the following paragraphs.</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font color="#000000" size="4"><font color="#FF0000">Geetham:</font> 
    is one of the simple musical forms and permits a student to learn a composition 
    without the complexities of Pallavai, Anupallavi, Charanam etc. It is a stepping 
    stone for the next higher musical form, the Kriti. Usually Geetham is sung 
    from start to finish without a break. Learning Geetham is very helpful in 
    voice training. Geethams themselves come in various forms such as Sadharana 
    or ordinary Geethamm; Sanchari Geetham and Lakshana Geetham (highlighting 
    the characteristics of ragas, both Janya and Janaka ragas).</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font color="#FF0000" size="4">Swarajati:</font><font color="#000000" size="4"> 
    Unlike a Geetham, a Swarajathi has divisions similar to a regular kriti into 
    Pallavai, Anupallavi, and Charanam. It is not necessary to have all three 
    divisions in every Swarajathis; some do not have Anupallavi. Swarajati is 
    useful for a student to learn the intricacies of both swaras and thalam or 
    rhythm control at the same time. While Swarajatis are useufl learning tools, 
    not all Swarajathis are simple and some Swarajatis composed by Shyama Sastri, 
    for example, are quite complex and requires extreme dexterity and knowledge 
    to render.</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font color="#FF0000" size="4">Varnam:</font><font color="#000000" size="4"> 
    Is the bridge between the two musical forms, Abhyasa Ganam and Sabha Ganam. 
    Learning many Varnams and in many ragams makes a student of music very proficient 
    in the art. Varnams, not only bring out the lakshana or characteristics of 
    a raga but, they also render the voice flexible and mellifluous and trained 
    in handling complex swara patterns and in obtaining control over layam or 
    timing. Varnams are divided into Pallavai, Anupallavi, Cahranam, Muktayi Swaras 
    and Charana Swaras. Two major varnams forms are: Tana varnam and Pada varnam; 
    sub-classification of these include: Padajati varnam, and Ragamalika varnams.</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font color="#660000" size="4">Taana varnam</font><font color="#000000" size="4">, 
    as the name implies, are in the form of tanams. In taana varnam, sahityam 
    and lyrics are used only in the Pallavi, anupallavi, and charnam. Taana Varanams 
    are used primarily for musical practice and are often set in madhyama (middle) 
    or Duritha (fast) tempo. In contrast, PadaVarnam, also known as ChaukaVarnam, 
    is sung in slow tempo (chaukakaala meaning vilamba or slow tempo) and hence 
    gives ample scope. Some of the well-known Taana varnams include Sarasijaakshhaa 
    in Kedara Gowlam, Saarasakshi in Kalyani, and Mahishaasura Mardhini in Andolika 
    (composer: Muthia Bhagavathar).</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font color="#660033" size="4">Pada varnams </font><font color="#000000" size="4">are 
    very often used during dance. Padams, when repeated, allow a dancer to exhibit 
    footwork and various expressions. Some of the well-known pada varnams include: 
    Chalamela in Natakurunji, Pankajakshi in Kamboji, Sami Ninnekori in Atana.</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font color="#660000" size="4">Padajati varnam</font><font color="#000000" size="4"> 
    is a hybrid of tana varnam because, in padajati varnam, some of the jatis 
    or rhythmic words spill into the main body of the varnam.</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font color="#660000" size="4">Ragamalika varnam</font><font color="#000000" size="4">, 
    as the name implies, is composed in several ragas.</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font color="#FF0000" size="4">Keertana:</font><font color="#000000" size="4"> 
    is a precursor to the kriti form of music. Keerthanas are generally in praise 
    of God, pleading to God or narrating some mythological events. In Keertana, 
    the lyrics are more important than the swaras or niravals. Keertanas are also 
    somewhat similar to Kritis in that they also have Pallavi, Anupallavi, and 
    Charanam divisions. It is also likely that there are several charanams in 
    a Keertana. Keertanas are particularly suited for group singing and for bhajan-type 
    environment where bhakthi and devotional singing is more important than musical 
    talent.</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font color="#FF0000" size="4">Kriti: </font><font color="#000000" size="4">Is 
    the highest musical form. It has clear divisions in terms of Pallavi, Anupallavi, 
    and Charanam (although some kritis do not have aunpallavis). Most of the great 
    composers's creations would fall under kritis. The great advantage of a kritis 
    is unlike, Geethams, kirtanas, and other forms, a kriti give much scope for 
    a musician to engage in creative embellishments such as niravals, sangatis, 
    etc. It also gives scope for thala or rhythm expositions and a kriti by starting 
    on various starting points or eduppus such as Samam, Anahata and Athita, provide 
    complexity during computational expositions. </font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font color="#FF0000" size="4">Ragamalikai: <font color="#000000">Is 
    a composition set in several ragas or a garland (malika) of ragas. Ragamalikas 
    are not restricted only to Kriti form but also extends to Geethams, Swarajatis 
    and Varnams. Each unit of a ragamalika will be set to a different ragam and 
    at the end of each unit, it will be denoted by Chitta Swarams set in the same 
    raga as that of the Pallavi. This type of signature is called Maguda Swarams. 
    The Sahityam or lyrics used duri ng the Maguda Swaram is called the Maguda 
    Sahityam and is useful for connecting the various units of a Ragamalika with 
    the Pallavi.</font></font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font color="#FF0000" size="4">Javali: <font color="#000000">Is 
    a musical form primarily used during dance. Most Javali's are set in madhyamakala 
    or medium speed. They mostly express simple themes including love and other 
    emotions expressed between a man and a woman. </font></font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font color="#FF0000" size="4">Thillana:<font color="#000000"> 
    Thillanas are popular both in Carnatic music concerts and during dance programmes. 
    Thillanas can range from the simple to the most complex in terms of its rhythmic 
    arrangements. Thillanas use both sahityams or lyrics and jatis or rhythm words 
    and generally set in medium or Madhyama kala.</font></font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">*************************************************************************</p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font color="#000000" size="4">The above discussion 
    highloighted some of the popular and frequently used musical forms. However, 
    this is not a complete list. Unlike the Hindustanti counterparts, Carnatic 
    music composers focus more on devotion and bhakthi and philosophy and less 
    on Sringara or love and romance. This is true of most of our composers regardless 
    of the State from which they hailed or the language that they used to compose 
    the songs. For example, Telugu composers such as Bhadrachala Ramadas, Giri 
    Raja Kavi, Kannada composers such as Purandaradasa, Kanakadasa, Malayalam 
    composers such as Swathi Tirunal, Sanskrit composers such as Jeyadeva, Narayana 
    Theertha, and notably, the Triniti from Tamilnadu have composed many songs 
    that had an undercurrent of bhakthi. Consequently, forms of music that highlight 
    the bhakthi and devotional aspects take prominence over other forms of music.</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font color="#000000" size="4">The musical forms that 
    highlight the bhakthi aspect had developed enormously in Tamilnadu, several 
    hundred years before the advent of other famous composers. Some of these examaples 
    include: Thevara hymns composed by Appar, Sundarar, Manickavasagar (Please 
    refer to their history in Carnatic Music Composer section), Nalayira Divya 
    Prabhandam of the Alwars; Thiruppugazh of Arunagiri Nathar, Thiruvarutpa of 
    Ramalinga Adigalar, and later day poets such as Subramania Bharathiar, Papanasam 
    Sivan, and Periyasami Thooran.</font></strong></p>
