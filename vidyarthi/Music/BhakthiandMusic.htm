          and bhakthi should be acquired and practiced with humility. Genuine 
          humility brings with it detachment, suppression or conquest of the baser 
          instincts of Man and, ultimately annihilation of the ego to bring enlightenment. 
          Mere scholarship without humility and music without devotion is according 
          to Thyagaraja Swami, akin to decorating a corpse. In the Sankarabharana 
          kriti, "bhakthi bhiksha meeyavayya," Swami says that the most well sung 
          song, if sung without devotion is like brocades and diamonds on a dead 
          man. In another kriti, "Samayamu thelisi," (Asaveri), he draws another 
          comparison - he who misses an opportunity to do good, performs only 
          an act similar to that of an open, but sightless eye. In the Malavsri 
          kriti, "Enallu thirigethi," he mentions the case of a scholar who, having 
          been invited to lunch by his admirers, neighbors and friends, settled 
          down to a long winded pooja, just to demonstrate his scholarship and 
          erudition, while keeping his hosts waiting.</font></b></font></P>
        <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The emphasis in our music 
          is humility (Vinaya) and devotion, and the giving up of pride and vanity 
          ("showing off" in common parlance", ego projection, etc. In the Mukhari 
          composition, "Sarasseruhasana," he laments that Brahmotsavam has gone 
          in Kaliyuga and that people have taken to neecha karma; they learn the 
          scriptures, not to practice virtues taught by the scriptures but to 
          show off and to make a living out of their learning. The simple path 
          to salvation is forgotten and, little interest is shown towards Truth. 
          For some, their interest is in the relative merits of saguna-nirguna 
          upasana; the secret of the ashta siddhis; the choice among the Shanmathas, 
          etc. Few choose the easy path to moksha or liberation from the cycle 
          of life and death. This is specifically referred to in "nadachi nadachi" 
          (Karaharapriya). In this composition, he refers to the state of Nirvana 
          "puthu chavvu lem thavvu," the place where there is neither birth nor 
          death. In the divyanama keertana "Rama Rama Krishnayanere", Thyagaraja 
          lists the common weaknesses of men and women and adds that, to get over 
          the consequences of these sins and to avoid committing them again and 
          again, we need to repeat the nama of the Lord. Then, he also tells us 
          why he chose Rama naama for chanting the name of God. It is relevant 
          to mention here that all schools of bhakthi recommend this path.</b></font></P>
        <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>We have already seen the 
          dogmatic approach of various mathaas and how Sri Thyagaraja prayed for 
          knowledge or "bedarahita Vedanta" - an approach that can bridge the 
          gulf separating the various schools, with different dogmas. Debate and 
          discussion however erudite, are of no real use if they don't do good 
          to society, as a whole. Naama Sankeerthanam or bajana which is the basis 
          of the first three forms of "nava vidha bhakthi" mentioned in the Bhagavata, 
          is ideal. In the Kalyani kriti, "Bhajana Seyave", he asks why debate 
          and discuss endlessly; realize that the body is subject to the goodness 
          of saptaswara, pranava naadha; realize bliss through Rama naama bhajana. 
          After advising in many kritis that namabhajana is the easiest marga, 
          he also tells us why he chose Rama as his chosen deity (Ishta Deiva) 
          and, Rama naama, for parayana.</b></font></P>
        <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><U><STRONG>Rama, the perfect 
          man:</STRONG></U> The kriti, "manivinaalakincha raa dhate" (Nalinakanti), 
          says that at a time when men were reeling under mere rituals of the 
          Karma Khaanda and wandering directionless in the forest of "bhava," 
          rama appeared as a man and taught mankind, the conduct that will lead 
          to salvation. "Mummoorthulu" (Atana), "Maakelara vicharamu" and "Rama 
          Rama" (Saveri) are compositions close to this theme.</b></font></P>
        <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Here, I may refer to the 
          5th Prana in the 4th Khanda of the Yajur Veda which contains the sacred 
          Rudram. In Rudram itself, it is namasmarana which is emphasized. The 
          name is stressed in "Namah Sivaya." It is said that namasamarana confers 
          on the devotee, the "panchaswaroopa gnana." These are: Paramathma swaroopa 
          gnana, Jeevatma swaroopa gnana, Upaya swaroopa gnana, Purushartha swaroopa 
          gnana and Vidriti swaroopa gnana. In common parlance, this means that 
          a devotee who recites the name regularly and with devotion, will get 
          knowledge of the ultimate and, before that, of the path to it; the obstacles 
          in the way, and, the benefits or fruits of taking that path.</b></font></P>
        <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The Nayanmars too have 
          sung these ideas in their "Devarams;" particularly Appar in his "Aindezhuthu 
          Pathikam" -- Aindezhuthu means five letters and they are, na ma si va 
          ya." Also, Thirumangai Azhwar, in his Thiruvaymozhi has stress this 
          - the Vishnumantram - Namo Narayanaya. Thyagaraja combined these two; 
          the Siva mantra and Madhava mantra, to form the "Rama mantra." In "evarani 
          nirnayinchira" (Devemrutavarshini), he says that the most important 
          letter is nama sivaya is "ma" and the most important letter in Vishnumantra 
          is "ra". If "ra" and "ma" are removed, both mantras would become meaningless 
          and absurd. So, he combined both these two important jeeva letters to 
          derive the word "Rama."</b></font></P>
        <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Thus, he created a common 
          plank for namasankeertana for both the Saivite and Vaishnavite schools. 
          In a lighthearted way, he says that his Rama is superior even to the 
          Hindu trinity - Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva as these three Gods, all have 
          some "defect" or other while, his Rama has none: "endunti vedalithiro" 
          (Durbar) lists the weakness of Siva, Vishnu, and Brahma and, praises 
          Rama's virtues (also refer to "emani pogadu thura" (Veera vasantham). 
          To Thyagaraja, Rama is a distinctly superior person: the kritis "eka 
          maata oka bhanamu oka pathni vrathude" (Harikamboji); "Vaadera daivamu 
          manasa" (Pantuvarali) and "Sarmegani anya marga vicharameti ke Oh manasa" 
          (Pantuvarali) etc., he asserts that Rama is the embodiment of virtues 
          and that the Trimurthis worshipped him. Hence, repeating his name in 
          groups, with music, is the surest and most pleasant way to moksha.</b></font></P>
        <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Here, a note of caution 
          in interpreting the Swami's approach and attitude to other gods - the 
          Trinity - is warranted. Scholars say that such comparisons and extolling 
          only Rama may be due to the fact that he might have been somewhat fanatical 
          in his earlier years, like any one of us, lesser people; and , it may 
          also be that in his exuberant devotion to his chosen Deity, he spoke 
          (rather humorously) highly one of his Rama. In this conflict, we may 
          also cite kritis such as "Laavanya Rama kanu lara joodave - nee manasu, 
          nee sogasu mee dinusu vere - thaamasa matha daiva mele, etc. (Poorna 
          shadjam). On the other hand, it was at a very later stage of his life 
          that he composed songs like "Paramathmudu velige" (Vagadeeshwari) in 
          which he stresses the immanence and universality of God in everything, 
          the animate and the inanimate, by whatever name we may choose to call 
          Him. To stress this, he explains these further in the charana of the 
          kriti. This kriti is well worth reading several times and understanding 
          fully.</b></font></P>
        <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>In the kriti "Ragaratna 
          malikache" (Ritigowla), he says that the Lord will be pleased with the 
          garland of a hundred gems which have been created as the sole means 
          for Thyagaraja's salvation. These gems of compositions have been created 
          from the truths propounded in the scriptures and of the kind that yogis 
          see and experience - Ananda. Many such songs are meant for singing in 
          chorus by the devotees. Hence, even though elaborately ornamented compositions 
          of the Swami are there for the virtuoso to demonstrate his voice range 
          and quality, and artistic skill, it is the songs composed for group 
          singing which will elevate the common man higher to planes of divine 
          experience. In "melu melu Rama nama" (Sourashtram), Swami explains the 
          ananda experiences at every level i.e. physical, emotional, intellectual 
          and spiritual, by singing Rama nama.</b></font></P>
        <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><EM><STRONG>The last few 
          kritis:</STRONG></EM> It is said that when Swami felt that his mission 
          on earth was completed, he sang the Ganavardini kriti "Daya choochutakidi 
          vela " meaning that it is time for you to take me into you, oh Lord, 
          as I have completed diligently and with devotion, the mission with which 
          you charged me on this planet." After this, Swami had a vision of Sri 
          Rama with the entourage (Giripainelakonna - Sahana). In this song he 
          says that he surely saw Sri Rama who assured him that he would be absorbed 
          in Him in ten days time. Swami then entered snayasarama. When nothing 
          happened as assured by the Lord, on the tenth day, he sang a reminder 
          - the kriti "Parithapamu Kaniyadina" (Manohari).</b></font></P>
        <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Mr. Shyama Rao, one time 
          thasildar of Thiruvayaru, records that after Swami sang this kriti, 
          an Omkara Naadha was heard and a jyoti was seen to emanate from the 
          head of Swami and traveled upward. Swami then slumped on the thambura 
          he was holding, and become one with the Lord.</b></font></P>
