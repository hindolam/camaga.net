<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>“It is
lucky that it is not raining today. Strange, how in some way one always has the
impressions of being fortunate, how some chance happening, perhaps
infinitesimal, stops us crossing the threshold of despair and allows us to
live. It is raining, but it is not windy. Or else, it is raining and is also
windy; but you know that this evening it is your turn for the supplement of
soup, so that even today you find the strength to reach the evening.” These
words sound so positive, matter-of-fact and so mundane almost, the reader will
be somewhat surprised to learn that they were written by someone who was
imprisoned at Auschwitz for more than a year and survived to write about the
horror and despair of that incarceration. It is Primo Levi writing in “If This
is a Man”.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>John
Steinbeck’s “The Grapes of Wrath” is the story of a Depression-era family in
America who journey from Oklahoma to California to escape the misery of their
home town which has turned into a dustbowl and in the hope that they can start
a new life in the west. (It is a beautifully written book. It also won
Steinbeck the Pulitzer Prize in1940 and was instrumental in his being awarded
the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962.) It weaves a sombre tale, including
murder, violence and death. One constant theme in the book nevertheless is the
protagonist family’s acceptance of its lot and the will to move on (at times literally)
even confronted by immense odds. </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'> In his
celebrated work of fiction, “The First Circle”, Alexander Solzhenitsyn
describes the lives of the inmates of a research bureau made up of prisoners
located in the suburbs of Moscow. One of these inmates is Gleb Nerzhin, a
mathematician-turned-historian who - among others - refuses to participate in
research that will benefit the Stalinist state. The central theme of this book
is how one can maintain human dignity within a system that is designed to seek
and destroy even the tiniest feeling of worth that the gulag occupants may
harbour. Nerzhin manages to hang on to his self-esteem by endeavouring always
to be an optimist and never losing hold of his inner self. In Solzhenitsyn’s
words, “it was only outwardly that he appeared ill-fated – secretly, he found
happiness in his very misfortune. He drank from it as from a spring. Here, in
prison, he was discovering people and events he could not have heard of
anywhere else on earth… And his wife – he knew he would return to her. After
all, the spiritual bond between them was unbroken. And he was seeing her today!
On his birthday! They would never allow her to visit him again, but what
mattered was today…. [When he meets her] he must tell her this… and that… and so
much else as well!”</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Inga
Clendinnen, the Australian academic and writer, describes how Primo Levi kept
scribbling notes to himself about his life in the camps and hiding them in
various corners of the laboratory in which he worked at Auschwitz. These were
notes that were prohibited, that he could not keep and which put him in mortal
danger. One could easily surmise that what motivated Levi to undertake such
risky action was the hope – however faint – that one day he may get out of the
camp alive and tell the world his story.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>“Then he
heard a sound; it was like hope coming tentatively back: a scratching and
whining. This was what one meant by dawn – the noise of life. He waited for it…
And it came: a mongrel bitch dragging herself across the yard, an ugly creature
with bent ears, trailing a wounded or broken leg, whimpering…. He could see her
ribs like an exhibit in a natural history museum. … Unlike him, she retained a
kind of hope. Hope is an instinct only the reasoning human mind can kill. An
animal never knows despair…. He came out into the yard and the animal turned
awkwardly – the parody of a watchdog – and began to bark at him. It wasn’t
anybody she wanted: she wanted what she was used to: she wanted the old world
back.” (From “The Power and the Glory” by Graham Greene.)</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>What is
common to all these heroes (including Green’s canine) is that they share what
Victor Frankl called a “tragic optimism”. Frankl (who had endured years of
horror in Nazi concentration camps and used his experiences to postulate a new
approach to psychotherapy) described this concept in the 1984 postscript to his
book, “Man’s Search for Meaning”, first published in 1946. There is a need for
human beings to remain optimistic in spite of the “tragic triad”, the triad of
pain, grief and death. This optimism may help “turn suffering into a human
achievement and accomplishment” and ensure that life retains its meaning in
spite of its adversity and tragedy.…. And how does one go about finding
meaning? The German psychologist, Charlotte Buhler, noted that we could do this
by studying “the lives of people who seem to have found their answers to the
question of what human life is about against those who have not.” Levi echoed
this when he wrote of his gulag friend, Lorenzo, that he believed that it was
due really to Lorenzo that he came out of Auschwitz alive. It was “not so much
for his material aid, as for his having constantly reminded me of his presence,
by his natural and plain manner of being good, that there existed a just world
outside our own, something and someone still pure and whole, not corrupt, not
savage, extraneous to hatred and terror; something difficult to define, a
remote possibility of good, but for which it was worth surviving.”</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>What is
also humbling is the fact these “heroes” would perhaps have not even considered
themselves to be that. They would have viewed themselves as ordinary beings
trying to survive in the face of extreme circumstances. As Marcus Aurelius
observed, “Living calls for the art of the wrestler, not the dancer. Staying on
your feet is all; there is no need for pretty steps.” </span></b></p>
