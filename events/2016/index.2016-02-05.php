                 <h4>Participation slot</h4>

		<h3><a name="violinWorkshop">Vocal and Violin workshop</a></h3>
		<h4> by illustrious violinist Sri Ganesh</h4>
		<p><i>June 18 - 24, 2016</i></p>
		<img src="events/2016/violinWorkshop/ganeshKumaresh.jpg"  style="max-width: 100%; height: auto" />
		<p>
			CAMAGA is pleased to announce that Sri Ganesh, the renowned violinist and vocalist (of the Ganesh and Kumaresh duo) will conduct a music workshop organized by CAMAGA during the month of June, 2016 in Atlanta (dates will be announced soon).  
			The workshop will be held for seven consecutive days. 
		</p>
		<p>
			This is a great opportunity for teachers, students, and others trained in Carnatic music (either vocal or violin) to learn from a senior musician.  
			We also encourage teachers and those with several years of training in music to register for the workshops to learn more about manodharma and other performing skills.  
			Ganesh would offer voice training, fingering techniques for those with a focus on violin, Manodharma, and more.  
		</p>
 		<p>
			The workshop will be offered to independent groups
			<ol style="padding-left: 40px">
				<li>Vocal – seniors</li>
				<li>Vocal – juniors (who have learnt at the least a few Varnams and Kritis)</li>
				<li>Violin Seniors</li>
				<li>Violin – juniors (who have had training in violin and are proficient in a few varnams and kritis)</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			The seniors, Vocal and Violin, would receive two hours of training per day while, juniors (grouped in to batches of 5 to 7 students), would receive one hour of training per batch per day.  
			Consequently, the number of registrants for the entire workshop will be restricted.
			The registration fee per participant for the one week session is $250 and it is payable in advance.  
			If you are interested in registering, please send an email to camaga.atlanta@gmail.com.  
			Because of the restrictions on the number of registrants, we will accept request for registration until the maximum participant for each group is reached (first come first served based on the date and time of receipt of the email.

			  <h3>Carnatic Mela - April 18, 2015</h3>
			  <h4>Saturday April 18, 2015 - 1 pm - 3:30 pm</h4>
			   <p>
                          CAMAGA organized a Carnatic Mela program to encourage younger kids learning music to participate
			  in enjoyable and yet simple music-related activities (e.g. choir singing, quiz program, symphony, and more).  
			  Since the purpose of the Mela was to make participation enjoyable and not strenuous, it was not similar to a competition.
			  There were no winners or losers.
                          </p>
                          <p>  
                          The Mela was held on April 18, 2015 at the Hindu Temple of Atlanta Auditorium between 1 PM and 3:30PM.
			 </p> 
			  <h4>PROGRAM</h4>

			    <h4>Swara Jamming</h4>
			    <p>Participantis were given a swara pattern – e.g. s r g p g m (Rupaka) and then he/she created the rest of the Sarali varisai.</p>
			      <h4>Raga Repertoire</h4>
			     <p>Participants had to identify the raga; sing the arohanam and avarohanam of the raga and a few phrases and lines from a composition</p>

			      <h4>Carnatic Quiz</h4>
				<p>
					This program was a quiz on Carnatic music conducted by the artists.  If no member from a group was able to answer a quiz question, the question was opened to the audience.
					The quiz tested the basic knowledge on Carnatic music.   
				</p>
			      <h4>Guess the Kriti</h4>
				<p>
					Trivandrum N. Sampath played a random line from anywhere inside a kriti on the violin. The participants had to guess the kriti. Some of the kritis were enduku peddala in Sankarabharanam,
Bantu reeti in Hamsanadam ....
				</p>	
                              <h4>Carnatic Choir</h4>
				<p>
                                    About 20 students of Jassotha Balasubramaniam performed carnatic kritis in a choir on violin. They were accompanied on mrduangam and ghatam. Here is a youtube
video of the performance.
