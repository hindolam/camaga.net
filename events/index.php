		<h3>Carnatic Mela 2016</h3>
		<p><i>Sat April 9, 2016</i></p>
               <p>
			<a target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/?q=Chinmaya Niketan">
				Venue:  <br/>
				Chinmaya Niketan<br/>
				Sri Rama Temple<br/>

		</p>
		<p>
			CAMAGA is organizing a Carnatic Mela.  The event is being organized to celebrate the centenary of Bharat Ratna Smt. M. S. Subbulakshmi, the illustrious musician. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The objective of the Mela is to encourage younger members of the community learning music to participate in enjoyable and yet simple music-related activities
			 (e.g. choir singing, quiz program, debate, and more).  The Mela would also include items that adults can participate (the adults group activities will be independent
			 of the kids’ group activities).  Since the purpose of the Mela is make participation enjoyable and not stressful, the format, unlike a music competition,
			will have no <emp>winners or losers</emp>.
  		</p>
 		<p>
			The event starts at 10 A.M. (with registration starting at 9:30 AM).  The Mela is scheduled for a total of seven hours including an hour of lunch break.  The Mela 
			also includes a concert, Nrithya Katha, and dance.  Carnatica Brothers – Sri Shashikiran and Sri Ganesh would be joined by Upanyasa exponent Smt. Suchitra 
			and Bharatanatyam exponent, Ms. Smitha Madhav.  The concert would be thematic, celebrating the memory of Smt. M. S. Subbulakshmi.  The artists will be accompanied
			on the violin by B. Raghavendra and on the Mridangam by Thiruvarur Bakthavatsalam.   At the end of the concert, certificates of `appreciation will be awarded by 
			Carnatica to the participants in the Mela.
		</p>
		<p>
			The concepts list given below describes the various events that are under consideration.
		</p>
		<h4>Carnatic Mela Concepts</h4>
		<ol style="padding-left: 1.1em;">
			<li>
				<h5>Show case Local Talent</h5>
				Three young performers (chosen in advance; the rules for the selection process will be announced soon) will perform, each for 15 minutes;
				we suggest that they focus on compositions that were popularized by Smt. M. S.  Subbulakshmi.
			</li>

				Local teachers will take the lead in putting together a choir; the participants can include both the teachers and their students or others they choose.
				Only two groups would perform and each group would be assigned twenty minutes maximum time
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Quiz, anthrakshari or multi-media presentation</h5>
			a kids group with a maximum of 4 participants (and a separate group of adults with 4 participants).  A multimedia quiz on Carnatic music would be conducted by the artists.  If no member from a group is able to answer a quiz question, the question will be opened to the audience participation. 				
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Musical Pattimandram</h5>
				30 minutes max including for the moderator to summarize.  Two groups of three individuals (only younger individuals) will debate against each other;  the topics are wide open – Bhakthi or Melody in Smt. M. S. Amma’s performance; Carnatic music as passion or career, how do we made Carnatic Music youth friendly or what makes MS a Carnatic Icon; we welcome suggestions for other interesting topics ).

			   <p>
                          CAMAGA organized a Carnatic Mela program to encourage younger kids learning music to participate
			  in enjoyable and yet simple music-related activities (e.g. choir singing, quiz program, symphony, and more).  
			  Since the purpose of the Mela was to make participation enjoyable and not strenuous, it was not similar to a competition.
			  There were no winners or losers.
                          </p>
                          <p>  
                          The Mela was held on April 18, 2015 at the Hindu Temple of Atlanta Auditorium between 1 PM and 3:30PM.
			 </p>

			      <h4>Carnatic Quiz</h4>
				<p>
					This program was a quiz on Carnatic music conducted by the artists.  If no member from a group was able to answer a quiz question, the question was opened to the audience.
					The quiz tested the basic knowledge on Carnatic music.   
				</p>
			      <h4>Guess the Kriti</h4>
				<p>
					Trivandrum N. Sampath played a random line from anywhere inside a kriti on the violin. The participants had to guess the kriti. Some of the kritis were enduku peddala in Sankarabharanam,
Bantu reeti in Hamsanadam ....
				</p>	
                              <h4>Carnatic Choir</h4>
				<p>
                                    About 20 students of Jassotha Balasubramaniam performed carnatic kritis in a choir on violin. They were accompanied on mrduangam and ghatam. Here is a youtube
video of the performance.
